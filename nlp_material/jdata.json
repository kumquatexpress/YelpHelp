I've been very pleased with their attention to these issues for my kids.  My oldest boy received early intervention for some early developmental delays and is now at or ahead of the level of his peers.  My youngest also received early intervention and is doing well also.  Although this intervention was funded by the state and not the JCC, their teacher at the JCC did a great job at addressing any issues we had and made sure we were comfortable with their growth and development.  Our teacher also has been at the JCC for more than 20 years.  The JCC also provides outstanding language screening by Kara Dodds and Assoc.\n\nJust a caveat here, \"early intervention\" actually can start prior to the age at which many children enter pre-school.  Screening can be done as early as 6 months of age and is provided by the California Early Start Program.  The San Diego Regional Center handles assessments and therapy.  My boys received services before age 2 and up to age 3.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:20:59Z","yelp_user_id":"4xnYsR1d7fy7gBlvSrBcVw"},{"business_id":"__PHRVOgyR-WgkKPHwnvoA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:23:50Z","date":"2009-01-30","review_id":"fTo8b-TmEWpLpouXPxfMLg","stars":4,"text":"My boys attended the Nierman Preschool at the JCC during the 2007-2008 school year.  They were 4 and 2 at the time.  \n\nThe things I liked about it:\n\nSecurity \nYou had to enter through the JCC main doors and then gain entrance to the preschool  inside the building which was a secured door with a receptionist.  You had to enter the secured double-doors with a membership badge (you don't need a membership to be in the preschool but you do get a huge discount for the preschool if you do) by sliding it through the reader or signing in with the receptionist.  While you had to wait for a parking spot most of the time, their security staff is very efficient (they have limited parking spots).  Some people probably didn't care for the lead security guy, EJ, because he reprimanded folks who speed in the parking lot, but let me tell you, he LOVES the kids there and his top priority is ensuring their safety.\n\nTeachers/education\nThere is a low turnaround at this school which says a lot about the school.  My older son's teacher has been with Nierman for over 15 years!  Most of the teachers there have been there on the average of 5-10 years.  They give a lot of attention indivually in an effort to focus on each child's needs (my child needed social facilitation).  They work on academics. Each week, they learn a letter of the alphabet and their activities are tailored around that letter. For example, one week they worked on the letter P and so they made pizza, sang songs and read books beginning with the letter P, talked about the color Purple, etc.  They do fun group physical activities in the gymnasium twice a week, the older kids get to spend time on the computers twice a week, plenty of outside time in their exceptional playground (that is centered in the middle of the preschool looking out at all -the classrooms) complete with clean well-kept climbing structures, slides, netting for climbing, swings, crawling-through structures, playhouse, etc. \n\nThe things I didn't like about it was:\nParking!  \nThey had limited parking spaces so if you caught them during a busy dropoff period you might have to wait 3-5 minutes to get a parking spot (which is directed by their security staff).  And if you had to attend a preschool event, parking was sometimes impossible.\n\nInclusion/special needs  \nMy kids both were diagnosed with autism this year.  Last year when they were in school, they were not yet diagnosed but had obvious social/language issues.  While the teachers did their best to work with them, they needed more one-on-one help then they were willing to acknowledge.  A month before the END of the school year, my oldest son's teacher suggested talking to  their inclusion department for some help.  I did but after meeting with her, she did not return my phone call and because the school year was ending I decided to seek help privately which is when I found out my boys were on the Autism Spectrum.  So, I was a bit disappointed about that.\n\nAll in all, it is a WONDERFUL school for typical preschool aged children, but I would caution you if you have concerns about your children especially if they have any developmental delays as they do not specialize in working with developmentally delayed children even if they tell you they are capable of handling your child.  Early intervention is IMPORTANT for kids with autism spectrum disorder - don't wait if you suspect any delays and talk with your pediatrician and push for screening so you can get appropriate services right away!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:51:00Z","yelp_user_id":"hEbcSU64r-4WzaXr5m4ABA"}]},{"business":{"business_id":"__rO-3gkVgaHRH158jA8OA","city":"Providence","created_at":"2013-03-15T06:42:00Z","full_address":"15 Peck St\nDownCity\nProvidence, RI 02903","latitude":41.8233,"longitude":-71.4098,"name":"Providence Cookie Co","open":true,"photo_url":"http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-z2imOce7WoPopy6N32gUw/ms.jpg","review_count":2,"stars":4.5,"state":"RI","updated_at":"2013-03-15T06:42:00Z","url":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/providence-cookie-co-providence"},"reviews":[{"business_id":"__rO-3gkVgaHRH158jA8OA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:09:22Z","date":"2010-07-04","review_id":"GoeMZPvgkiBtQm6uE6HAoQ","stars":4,"text":"Kind of hidden from the major downtown thoroughfare, Providence Cookie Company has been a Providence treat for many, many years.

Ordering a meal here was such a freakin ordeal.

I feel like all Indian restaurant staff NEEDS to go to hospitality school to learn not to have your dirty hands all over my glass of water. Seriously.

I mean I don't think you can go wrong with tikki, but it was really good. The Pani Puri on the other hand = BLAH.  I mean you're looking at a girl who worked at a \"chaat place\" as a teenager, the \"pani\" (spicy water) part was too spicy and not the right flavor and the filling part was this gooey mess of potatoes and chick peas which was horrifying.

It's got tandoori chicken, lamb saag, daal makhani, and your choice of curry for just $35. They say it feeds 2, but 3 of us shared it and still all got full. The tandoori chicken was HELLA JUICY that time. I don't even like tandoori chicken that much, but it was really good. \n\nThe buffet, as everyone else says, is a good deal too ($8.95). They have tandoori chicken (not as good as it was for dinner), palak paneer, mixed vegetables, daal makhani, and chicken tikka masala. I can't remember everything else but it was about 8 dishes total, plus the deserts. The Kheer was definitely the best kheer I've ever had (not saying that much though). It's rice pudding, if you don't know what it is. It was super smooth and tasty. \n\nOh and they have outdoor seating now, with the new park being built as others have said.

I came to see if it could meet the promise of less-greasy restaurant food.\n\nThe starches offered were standard white rice, which was fine, and naan.  The naan felt mass-produced -- cooked in the oven in tall piles with butter, then sliced and laid out -- with no detectable layers.  That was a serious handicap to tearing and eating with one hand.\n\nThe other items were:\n1. Gobi Pakora - not super greasy, and I think I tasted a little bit of rock salt (think Wendy's chili sauce), which is soo awesome. \n2. Palak Paneer - way too mild; would satisfy if you like the dish purely because it consists of spinach and cheese.\n3. Mixed Vegetable Stir-Fry: WEIRD.  not only standard issue mild, but sweet.  And consisting of an awful-lot of \"English\" or \"New World\" vegetables, esp. corn. beans, and squashy things.  This was either a clever spin on the First Thanksgiving menu and Columbus' anthropological confusion, or the handiwork of the Jolly Green Giant.  But, hearty and not greasy at all.  So, sucks to the Smallpox Champions. \n4. Yellow Dal - It's dal, it's good for you, and it tastes like that. But if I'm gonna eat it at a restaurant, I'm gonna want a more robust preparation, with stuff like garlic, ginger, caramelized onions, chunks of tomato, A GOD DAMN CHILI PEPPER, etc.  Still, from the standpoint of keeping things basically healthy, they're doing a good job.\n5. Chicken Shrimp Curry - Shrimp gross me out.\n6. Chicken Tikka Masala - Really, abjectly mild, but props for not going nuts with the goopy greasiness.  Too bad this is an absurd menu item.\n7. Tandoori Chicken - Always a hit or miss item, esp. at a buffet.  Here it was the one thing I simply could not finish.  I grabbed a drumstick, took a bite, tasted the unvarnished mediocrity of culinary protein that is underspiced Chicken, and put it down (on my plate, not back on the buffet.

Making mattters worse: they add sweetener to their raita, which makes me want to retch; and the red onion compote pickled awesomes weren't put out until halfway through the meal.  \n\nHOT TIP for enjoying an Indian buffet that feels underspiced:\n\nI went over to the gentlemen that work here and asked for achaar (pickle).  Because it was a punjabi place, they brought out just what I had hoped: Pachranga mixed pickle!  A tremendous taste experience, that Pachranga.  It has awesome stuff like pickled carrot, mango, and LOTUS ROOT(!), and the spices include saunf, the same stuff that you munch on from the mukhwas tray on your way out.

The food always comes out piping hot and there is always enough to take home! Sometimes the service is a bit slow but it is always worth the wait! The prices are very reasonable and I always come back with someone new. I've even converted my boyfriend who is NOT a very adventurous eater :)\n\nThe restaurant itself is located in a very convenient location in Central Square. It has outdoor seating and lucky for them there is a small gathering area built by the city which is right in front of their doorsteps. In the summer time, it is a great place to people watch! I'm also big on the decor of a restaurant and the Desi Dhaba gets my stamp of approval. The ceiling looks like a replica of a palace ceiling of what you would probably expect to find in that part of the world, the columns are a nice touch and I definitely appreciate the Indian music played. There is a small bar in the restaurant and they appear to have a wider variety of beer than I would expect. Definitely a place I enjoy going to!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:13:46Z","yelp_user_id":"MoyaBSh6Lwvi8wyOX48ZNQ"},{"business_id":"_--ScmaNumIoT2gQanACvg","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:38:47Z","date":"2007-05-01","review_id":"HUcfTTkDNfKyhz6LXWqNBQ","stars":4,"text":"note Start rating is only for dishes I've tried and like at their place:\n\n1.

It was also the second pleasant surprise in a row on the fringe the Central Square, which should be renamed Indiatown. In short, Desi Dhaba was quite good.\n\nTo start, they flavored the rice. This may seem like a no-brainer, but so many buffets (even in Indian-heavy Cambridge) have plain old white rice that it's a treat to see a few seeds and other flavoring mixed in. It's a simple, but very nice touch. At the other end of the buffet sat a basket of surprisingly good naan. Normally there's a clear line between naan that is served tableside and it's more soggy in-the-buffet version. But DD was busy enough that the staff was constantly refilling the relatively small basket. As a result, warm crispy-chewy (the way I like it) bread awaited me on every trip.\n\nThe salad bar was modest, but nicely done, with one or two fruit (melon) options mixed in. The cauliflower pakora appetizer impressed us with its flavor and crispiness. Again I have to credit the crowd and the need for constant refills. I imagine things would have been a little different if we had gone very early or late, when things were a bit slower.\n\nDesi Dhaba had six main dishes (a good number) and I liked all of them. Not one really stood out, but they were all solid. The palak paneer was pretty good, if a bit skimpy on the paneer. But after almost a dozen different buffets in the area, I've come to accept that as standard. Mixed veggies were quite tasty. The chicken/shrimp curry didn't have much shrimp, but I didn't miss them. The yellow dal was done well, as was the tandoori chicken (cut into smaller pieces than I normally see). And the chicken tikka masala was maybe a little watery, but also quite good.\n\nThe rice pudding (kheer) was very good, and you could really taste the underlying spice (cardamom or nutmeg or whatever it was) in a good way. My roommate felt it was one of the better ones we had tasted.\n\nThe atmosphere was light and not incredibly Indian. A flat screen t.v. above the buffet showed a news channel. Service (water refills etc.) was a bit slow, but there was quite a crowd. In fact, I had to wait in line for the buffet, something I almost never see on a Friday afternoon buffet. But it was always a short wait and I wasn't bothered, especially when it resulted in all the food being more fresh and tasty anyway.\n\nDesi Dhaba is down Mass Ave. a couple blocks from Central Sq. on the way to MIT. At $7.95, it was my favorite in the immediate area and I'd recommend walking a couple extra blocks to choose it over the nearby competitors. But if you are on the other side of the square, closer to Harvard, I'd recommend India Castle.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:42:34Z","yelp_user_id":"NEYtQfI55JXZqb1byz_Xug"},{"business_id":"_--ScmaNumIoT2gQanACvg","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:03:17Z","date":"2011-08-19","review_id":"IF9CVsBKS86F271vJfKwRg","stars":3,"text":"They have a great $8 lunch buffet M-F and I think it's either $11 or $12 on the weekends.

They make fresh naan and bring it out in batches so that it never gets cold or hard.

Indian food can be....hit or miss....and they table cloths and place settings made it look too classy for my shop-worn hands to rest in. No, \"another time\" always seemed the resolve when I went out to eat.\n\nThankfully, Thanksgiving gave* me an opportunity to finally try it out. Let me be concise (for a change). This place is delicious. The menu is extensive, offering a smattering of paneers and curries of every taste. I spent several minutes examining and combining foods in my mind until I found the perfect opportunity. A sampling of samosa, lamb curry, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, naan, kheer, and raita. A dream come true! And a relative bargain at $15.00. \n\nThe service, if we're being honest, was not the best. They weren't rude, but they weren't exactly attentive either. I did have to remind them that I was missing my samosa and tandoori chicken, and I don't think I ever saw the daal that was supposed to come with my naan, but they were apologetic and happy to correct the mistakes. \n\nThe food though, was some of the best I've had and a fine choice if you're around Central. The curry had more meat than sauce, a pleasant rarity in my experience (some other places give essentially a cube of meat in a bucket of sauce. Not exacly substantial.).

This is one of the main reasons why I decided to complete my undergrad studies here. There are many libraries, but the main one, Geisel, is very big. The librarians and other staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.\n\nWhen it comes to professors, I would say it is a mixed bag. There are some very good and some very poor professors. I have had more good professors than poor professors. One major complaint about professors at UCSD is that many are non-native English speakers. This makes it tough to understand the lecture and certain real-world examples are either miscommunicated or not relevant to American culture. \n\nMy advice to anyone considering or are currently attending UCSD is don't expect to have your education handed to you on a silver platter. You will have to study long hours and in groups. Lectures should be viewed as mandatory as well as discussion sections. While in lecture PUT THE DAMN COMPUTER AWAY and pay attention. \n\nThe students really are the worst part about UCSD. There is a sense of entitlement and selfishness among much of the student body. There are more inconsiderate students than there are passionate ones. This may be different in majors other than economics, though.\n\nThe campus is very large and can be a burden if you have back to back classes on different ends. There is only 10 minutes passing time scheduled between classes. Parking is limited, so get there early or take the bus. Buses are usually packed, so catch an early one or you will be standing in line. If you ride a bike, don't ride it on the library walk or you may get ticketed.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:02:55Z","yelp_user_id":"9S0VFqNFSi-75y6eIuH0Fg"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:51:28Z","date":"2006-12-12","review_id":"-efhfzgaqayncxmbhByoXw","stars":5,"text":"Revelle College REPRESENT!!\n\nI actually truly enjoyed studying at UCSD and got an excellent education here.

Seeing the few students who do live nearby walk to class is almost as absurd as watching people walk in pirate costumes or Star Trek TNG uniforms down a city street, they look so out of place.\n\nUCSD is just a maze of suburban sprawl in the middle of more suburban sprawl.  I think the academics of this college are an afterthought.  People come to UCSD because they want to be in San Diego and they also want to go to a decent college with a decent reputation.  This college is riding on the fact that it is the largest and most prestigious higher educational institution in San Diego.  As San Diego is a major city that has experienced rapid population growth, sustained economic prosperity, and a continued influx of wealthy and intelligent people, it would simply be impossible for this university to do anything other than thrive.\n\nEcologically, the campus is rather fake.  Lots of Eucalyptus groves, ice plant, artificial-looking grassy lawns, everything maintained by sprinkler systems.  Everything treated with chemicals.  They even spray chemicals right around the kid's playground in daycare in the grad student housing.  You can watch the kids come out the next day crawling around in the grass, probably getting all different kinds of cancer.  Reminds me of the cancer of suburban sprawl emanating from UCSD to the south, east, and north.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:04:33Z","yelp_user_id":"tx7RTGrlLKBG9c93lnio5Q"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:01:31Z","date":"2009-09-22","review_id":"0eqhkH0GrMNogc4DYBzDMw","stars":5,"text":"I loved my time at UC San Diego.

In certain areas, I could give it a single star; on others, a 5. The campus is absolutely magnificent and truly makes up for any downfalls the university may have. \n\nThe students are quiet intellectuals who you cannot bribe for notes, no matter what. It's competitive as hell. Want or need notes? Well, you better kiss someones butt because no one wants you getting a better grade than themselves. Once, I remember a girl asking me for two weeks worth of notes and I questioned her like a PI. While I'm sitting in class typing 90 WPM, trying to pick up everything the instructor is saying so that I can actually pass the course, you put in zero effort. I think not.\n\nI went to UCSD twice. Once to obtain my BA and the second to get my minor, When I went back to finish my minor in 2011, there were a lot of changes. The Rady School of Business was completed. So was the parking structure near the Social Sciences building (finally!). I feel that UCSD truly wants to be the best, and you can tell by the way they take care of the campus. \n\nBack in 2007, I had the fortunate experience of living in the dorms (Warren Apartments-Black Hall). Apparently, only graduate students can reside there now. Living on campus was one of the most amazing experiences of my life because everyday I took advantage of the opportunities and amenities. I went to watch movies in the price center. I rode my bicycle to class everyday. I took 2 hour runs around the campus; even at 11 at night. I tried the food at every college. If I wanted to study at Geisel at one in the morning during finals week, I could just walk there. I will never forget my stay on campus. If you at all have the opportunity to live in the dorms, please do so.\n\nThe downfall of UCSD, however, is its liberal arts. You will learn theory; tons and tons of theory. You will learn history. You will write a lot. You will have to and want to prove yourself to students and professors, often. You will read more than you have ever read in your life (I just started leisure reading after years of putting it off because UCSD knocked the enjoyment of reading out of me). Finally, you will not make many friends because the school is competitive and frankly, you will not have much time to socialize.\n\nMoreover, you will rarely learn to implement your knowledge. I fought hard sifting through hundreds of courses trying to find one that had a more hands on approach. Even when I thought I found one that was more practical, the classes were sometimes boring and consisted mostly of theory and history on the subject matter.\n\nIf you want to be intellectually stimulated and surround yourself with some extremely intelligent peers, then this is a great school for you. However, be very careful when selecting the courses you take. READ THE CAPE AND GO BY IT. The cape has rarely done me wrong. Make sure you are willing to put in the effort. UCSD is not necessarily hard, but you do have to be extremely dedicated to your education.\n\nIn terms of the people, I find that if you are not a science major, you will see plenty of attractive young guys and girls. They may not be stereotypically good looking but who wants ordinary? Trust me, people who have personality and intelligence will keep your interest much longer than those who are good looking but shallow.\n\nThere you go. This is my summation for UCSD being a Sociology major with an emphasis in science and medicine. The hard sciences, I know to be much, much worse. Trust me when I say, I feel bad for the kids who have to endure years of tough classes and competition. Especially since in the hard sciences, professors often grade on a curve.\n\nThere is so much more to write but I don't have time; I will have to save my additions for another day.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:12:17Z","yelp_user_id":"CSIc4hf87BEQC3sdxbT1GA"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:44:10Z","date":"2008-07-10","review_id":"1_AQ0vAFft4TYBSjH9Os-Q","stars":5,"text":"OMG!!!

I spent the past five years of my educational life here. Last year, I completed the first year of my graduate work in the Education Studies (EDS) program. I also worked as a staff for the TRIO Outreach Programs. Currently, I am in the second (and last) year of the EDS program.\n\nI was introduced to the university by an outreach officer from San Diego. He pulled me out of class and helped me fill out the application. Soon after, I was admitted to the UCSD Eleanor Roosevelt College Class of 2007. Later, I got an early start to college by participating in the Summer Bridge program ran by OASIS. Since then, my life as been going full speed.\n\nBeing a math major and a part of the (EDS) program as an undergrad, I felt the best thing I got out of college was the practical experience. The faculty at UCSD is dedicated to their research work. Fortunately for me, the research performed by EDS involves training better teachers. For others, you have to seek out the support. \n\nPeople say that the staff and faculty at UCSD do not care. You really must be pro-active in getting the help. It's true: no one is going to knock on your dorm room door and explain to you how to graduate in four years. You have to make an effort see a academic counselor and have them walk you through a four-year plan. Trust me, they are nice. There are many resources on-campus to help with whatever you need. Other programs like the Office of Academic Support and Instructional Services (OASIS) offer free tutoring and job opportunities for qualified undergraduates.\n\nNow that I have graduated and got into grad school, I can see that the standards for admission have gone up. Like hundreds of students now, I can say that I am one of those that probably would not have gotten in had I applied now.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:06:47Z","yelp_user_id":"htiA6TToN064Sh2kogdQ6g"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:51:29Z","date":"2007-07-02","review_id":"4rMq6E7IiWeuB1-yMJGImw","stars":4,"text":"For my 100th review, I thought I'd write about the very reason why I came to San Diego: UCSD.\n\nI really really liked the school when I checked it out as a high school student.  I liked it so much, that I turned down UCLA, Berkeley, and Stanford, to go to the campus down by the sea, and see what trouble I could get into and what adventures I could have.  \n\nFirst off, what attracted me as an undergraduate in 2001 was the college system.  While having over 20,000 students, UCSD's undergraduate college system--which breaks the population down into six smaller, liberal arts colleges, tries to build a spirit of community while giving you the access to a big school's resources.  I was really impressed with my college, Eleanor Roosevelt, when I showed up as a senior and the dean of students came out and talked to me for nearly an hour, something I'm sure wouldn't happen at most other UCs.\n\nThe college system can be a trifle tricky, but it's comforting to know that your major isn't affected significantly by your college choice--however, there are certain prerequisites that fit in with the philosophy of each college--i.e., Thurgood Marshall emphasizes civil rights and American citizenship, Roger Revelle places heavy stress on taking math and science regardless of discipline, etc--so keep that in mind.\n\nThe campus itself is really nicely laid out, it's a bit big, but the center of the campus is a walkway called library walk, that connects the library (named after Dr. Seuss and shaped like an enormous Broccoli of Knowledge).  During a regular school day, look for library walk to be crowded with everything from fraternity pledges, to Korean barbecue sales, to Christian groups singing songs, to the occasional renaissance fair production.  It's crazy.\n\nI loved my classes, my departments, and the choices I had there.  I was a double major in history and religious studies, and took enough classes to be a theatre minor although I didn't declare it.\n\nNow, as for diversity, all I can is simply thus:  UCSD tries hard.  And doesn't succeed entirely well.  For people of color, particularly Latinos, African-Americans, Filipinos, and Native Americans, the campus can feel a bit unfriendly, particularly if you're used to people looking like you, or feeling like you're not the 'only one.'  There are amazing resource centers at UCSD, however, for people wanting to connect with larger community--UCSD boasts a Women's Center, LGBT Resource Center, and a Cross Cultural Center, all of which provide safe spaces for discussion, dialog, and community forming.  Join them!\n\nIf I had some suggestions to make, in all honesty, they would be:\n\n* get involved:  Getting involved is ESSENTIAL to being at UCSD.  UCSD lacks some of the traditional 'social structures' of other schools, but there is no end to a sense of community if you seek one out.  There are clubs/organizations/groups for anything from French films to Hinduism to playing magic the gathering.  Find your niche.  Do it.\n\n* Take advantage: From scholarships, to study abroad, to job opportunities, TAKE THEM.  you won't regret it.  I feel that perhaps doing a little of everything (like i did) may not be the best, but as a former: Resident Advisor, Orientation Leader, Tour Guide, Course Grader, and Study Abroad participant (in South Africa), I must say that it is SO VERY WORTH IT to take advantage of whatever opportunities are available.\n\n*Explore San Diego:  There's so much more to UCSD than La Jolla; if only I'd known that my first two years here.  Go to Balboa Park.  The Zoo.  Scout around.  Find new places.  The farther from LJ, the better.\n\n--because I'm crazy, I then went back to UCSD for a one year masters in history.  It was intense, but very worth it, and for you potential UCSD graduate students out there, please definitely take advantages of grad student socials, things put on by the GSA (Grad Student Association), and meet people outside of your department.  It will do you nearly as much good as a pint at porters after six hours of reading for a seminar the next day.\n\nAll in all, UCSD has been plenty good to me.  A great campus, high rated faculty, super involvement opportunities, and so much more.  While diversity is a bit lacking, and one does have to find opportunities on ones own initiative, it's an amazing campus, and I'm glad to have my two degrees from there.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:47:47Z","yelp_user_id":"xN-xoLhTHUFfTS_BMGG0xg"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:51:06Z","date":"2011-05-12","review_id":"569P7KPIGEJ5qSH6DdLAMQ","stars":4,"text":"If you are a social animal, going to UCSD shouldn't be a problem regardless.

Unfortunately, we went during Welcome Week, and not only was the place a zoo, but we almost got ran over by a bunch of Sixth College freshmen, complete with face paint, running around in a fashion similar to that of a flock of birds (minus that whole flying thing).  And I hate to be a superficial space cadet, but the \"campus faces\" really are getting uglier and shorter.  I guess that's what happens when the school starts becoming more competitive and the \"smarter\" kids are overtaking the campus by a storm (or flock).  \n\nDespite my shallowness though, I have nothing but love for my college campus.  \n\nFirst of all, what other college campus do you know has a talking tree?

The school is large enough and diverse enough for everyone to find something of interest.\n\nAs far as education goes (the part that I've been told should matter the most), the degree (mine is in Computer Engineering) is a great buy.

People are very ugly here\n\nIts hard for me to say how I feel about UCSD.  During my freshman year, I thought I made a mistake.  Now that I have graduated, I am really glad I went to UCSD.   I made some really great friends and had a great time.   After a semi-crappy first year, I decided to take advantage of being a college student and tried to do as much as possible.  I went to many free concerts on campus and joined a couple of clubs/orgs.  I studied abroad and participated in the UCDC program (I highly recommend doing this program).   When I turned 21, I explored PB, downtown and other random bars.   \n\nFor me, UCSD holds a special place in my heart because at the beginning of spring quarter of my sophomore year, my dad passed away.  I was very surprised at the amount of support I received at UCSD.   I was an ERC student and the assisant res dean was very helpful and encouraged me to take time off if needed.  All of my professors were supportive and let me make up my work at my own pace.   People may say that students here are anti-social but during this rough time for me, my friends and other kids living in the dorms around me were so nice.  People  I hardly knew were giving me class notes or buying me a meal with their meal points.   \n\nI cant really comment on what classes were like because I dont remember them.

UCSD served me well when I was studying biochemistry. I got a legit position in a lab, and learned so much doing hands-on work. I felt like my courses sufficiently supplemented my work, and everything was just fine. But when I switched majors to pursue my love of music, everything changed.\n\nGranted, the music department is not a big one. However, the curriculum is embarrassingly rudimentary... as in \"I could have passed this upper division course when I was 10.\" I do not feel that the courses required of me for graduation will sufficiently prepare me for graduate work, or even graduate school applications. In light of statewide budget cuts, UCSD's music program was hit particularly hard. I was recently told that my major, vocal performance, may even be nixed, and turned into an even more generalized BA. That... is just sad.\n\nIn addition, the administration is downright incompetent. Recent events (the highly publicized racial tensions) have exemplified the University bureaucracy's flaws.\n\nTaking the fee hikes into consideration, I truly believe that UCSD is no longer one of the best bangs for your buck in education. The 32% increase puts our tuition right up there, next to the average private school. And for all that mollycoddling, alumni networking, job placement, smaller class sizes, better faculty:student ratio, and superior facilities, I say go ahead and splurge on USC or Claremont. \n\nBottom line: the tuition has risen to the point where the costs outweigh the benefits.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:48:24Z","yelp_user_id":"4ZTjbIwRTzBD3ZDKstNMzA"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:00:27Z","date":"2008-09-27","review_id":"Bo-xi0sNo2Du7JJ5gpyEbg","stars":3,"text":"UCSD has wonderful professors that make you feel like you're getting a truly elite college education at a public school (albeit still expensive...but public school) price.

They acknowledge the problems on campus, and try to change them. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts, but they try.

Nope. Full of old snobby rich people and everything shuts down at 6 pm. Hillcrest (by SDSU) is better but it's like a 30 minute drive. Lamest university + university area in existence.

I transferred from another UC and have attended two community colleges and a CSU  so I can say without a doubt that this is the worst decision I have ever made in my life and will regret it forever. I would never wish harm upon anyone, but, the staff, especially the ones that work in the Registrar's, Student Business Services, Financial Aid, and Sixth College offices, deserve to DIAF. \n\nIn order from hell-ish to tolerable:\n\n1. HORRIBLE ADMINISTRATION: Inefficient, incompetent, ineffective, inept, etc, etc, etc. Expect to call or visit at least 5 different offices to resolve your problems. Not helpful at all. They have no compassion and no understanding how their stupidity NEGATIVELY affects our lives. I started SOBBING uncontrollably while talking to the dean of Sixth College. All she said was she'll ask around and call me back. She has yet to call me back. They make mistakes and they literally make you pay $$$$ for it (I currently owe over $2000 because of their mistakes. I'm sure I'll be able to pay it back in no time, seeing as how my mom is on unemployment and I have a kick-ass part-time job!).\n\n2. Academic Advising: is non-existent. They don't advise. They smile and nod their heads and pretend like they care. The \"virtual advising center\" is a joke. No one ever fully answers your questions. They regurgitate shit already posted on the website. \nWhen I went to see the counselors at community college (PCC), they would make the appropriate phone calls, ask their superiors and Google info for me. The ones here told me to either ask a different department or do my own research. Um, why would I even bother coming to you if I could find the answer on the Internet? Again, they make mistakes and you will pay for it.\n\n3. Sixth College: \na. CAT 125, the upper division writing requirement for Sixth college is clusterfuck of a course. Useless. Fun for people who have large enough egos to fill 10-15 pages.\nb. Art-making requirement: 8 units (2-3 courses) in an \"art\" course. \n\n4. The Students: There's something very strange about UCSD students. They seem to have a knack for finding nice people and asking for help over and over again and then never ever returning the favour. They love to take but they never give any back. I admit I'm guilty of this.\n\n5. La Jolla: Awful place to be if you don't have a car. Everything is spread out and far away. Downtown San Diego is \"accessible\" by public transportation if you have 2-3 hours to spare. No good food in La Jolla. All the fruits seem to taste like rubber erasers. Trader Joe's might be the safest option. Because SD is so close to the Mexican border where there are a bunch of factories and home to military bases, there is a lot of water pollution. Buy bottled water (and recycle it) or bring a water filter and change the filter often!\n\n6. UGLY ASS CAMPUS: Biomedical Library is the only building I like and the only place I can actually study.\n\n7. Housing: Tolerable, but much too expensive for the shit place you're renting. Live near Hillcrest. It's cheaper and the Hillcrest shuttle is really convenient. Better food and \"life\" there as well. If you do choose to live near campus, choose an apartment complex that offers free printing. There are several of them like La Scala and International Gardens (I prefer La Scala. The staff is much nicer and more helpful).\n\nMy suggestions: \n-DO NOT APPLY! If you do, don't apply for Sixth College or Eleanor Roosevelt. And apply as a transfer student. Lower-division courses and GE courses here are insufferable and a excruciating prolonged cockblock. \n-Do well at community college and transfer to a small, private school where you exist as a real person. Being at a large school makes you a statistic. \n-Attend a private school. Public schools, especially ones in CA are subject to frequent budget cuts. Your fees go up by 30%, your favorite professors get cut, and the administration and the UC Regents chillax in their $20 million dollar mansions. \n-Attend a school with a large budget.\n-Do not attend a school where certain majors (sciences) are HEAVILY favoured over other majors, unless you are majoring in the sciences. Social sciences, humanities and arts are the first things to get cut when there are budget cuts (I had a condescending graduate students teach an UPPER DIVISION course. Didn't learn a thing.)\n-If you want to attend a school with a college system, I recommend UC Santa Cruz (or you can look across the pond). Their college system is significantly better and the college requirements are more reasonable, just a writing requirement. SD's GE requirement vary greatly depending on your college (Eleanor Roosevelt has an infamous 6-quarter writing requirement. If you have two years to spare on writing research papers, go for it!)\n-If you're choosing SD because of the nice weather and beaches, FYI: this is California. Every other school is by the beach and has nice weather","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:44:49Z","yelp_user_id":"0WUmC55Cnvg94mhzdmvT5Q"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:46:15Z","date":"2011-01-11","review_id":"J9-90aWod8NaXgQj2AqDnQ","stars":5,"text":"As I near my departure from this great campus at UCSD, I'll always wonder what would have been?  \n\nIf I were a terrible surfer - Would I have never come here?\n\nIf I didn't like the Sun, Beach, Sand, Surf, Cali - Would I have come here?\n\nIf I didn't like babes - Would I have come here?\n\nIf I didn't break my leg and decided not to go into medicine - Would I have come here?\n\nBoy I'm glad none of those things ever happened!

I have to say my experience was really great. I'm from orange county, and although it took me a few months to warm up to the super-chill vibe, my experience was guided by the stunning beaches and amazing mexican food. \n\nUCSD has a weak greek life, as there is no football team that encourages parties, or other major sporting events. So my pride for UCSD was definitely limited in comparison to other football-driven schools. The way to really enjoy your experience @ UCSD, as with other schools I would assume, is to get involved in something. Whether its greek life, service organizations, ethnic groups, religious groups, whatever group, get involved! You aren't in high school where cliques come easy. Becoming involved in something you are interested in and surrounding yourself with people that share commonality is important, and I believe UCSD does have strong student life opportunities. \n\nSan Diego is a hidden gem, and for many students, its easy to go through your 4 years thinking its a hard rock. There are so many great areas filled with good eats, things to do, and places to hang out so don't miss out! Research on yelp! Surround yourself with good company, and go exploring because you wont be disappointed. Also the mexican food is amazing, and mexico is just a short drive away! Go grub it up on some dollar tacos and cheap lobsters at puerto nuevo. \n\nUCSD is filled with bright students who often know how to have fun while taking care of their business.

Okay, here's the tip: go to office hours and ask questions. Put a name on your face. A lot of times, professors are much different outside of lecture. They are friendlier, more down to earth, open and honest. Only a couple of times, I encountered an arrogant one, but they were arrogant in lecture too, so I wasn't surprised. This is especially important down the line when you need letters of recommendation for grad school, law school, etc. You want a professor to know who YOU are and not write a generic statement about you. So get to know them and you'll understand why I love most of the professors here.\n\nThe environment is absolutely beautiful. Its located minutes away from the beach. La Jolla has plenty to offer, UTC is not far from the school, and you are located very close to the freeway so easy access.\n\nCons:\n\nParking. UCSD is illogical when it comes to parking. During my senior year here, they decided to add MORE faculty parking spaces by eliminating undergraduate spaces...even in the most distant parking lots. The stupid part is, the faculty spaces rarely fill up. Heck, it never did unless it was after hours when it was free for all. \n\nStudent activity/social atmosphere is pretty dull here. It takes one to know one though and I admit, I am one of those stereotypical UCSD student that doesn't like to say much in class, plays Wordscraper on Facebook, watches anime, and prefers spending their weekends writing reviews on Yelp instead. ~winks~ Its just not the most sociable atmosphere and it doesn't help that many times, your classmates are just as quiet as you are. Sometimes, i think the fraternities should be renamed the Anime Otaku Club instead. UCSD fraternities? Hahaha! I'm making myself laugh!\n\nConclusion: My best years were spent at UCSD.

There are views of the ocean from some of the buildings, including certain dorm rooms! There are hiking/running trails located right behind our very cool, futuristic looking library. UCSD is in La Jolla, minutes from La Jolla Shores. Not even the most spoiled of spoiled brats could complain in that respect. \n\nI love the fact that UCSD has a green/sustainability energy program. It includes biogas fuel cells, wind energy, and solar panels! Being so involved at this university, I'm ashamed I don't ride my bike more, and even more ashamed that I still (shhhhh) drive a SUV - which, in my defense, I am desperately trying to get out of! Really though, UCSD is one of the greenest universities nationwide, and that in itself is just awesome.\n\nI also appreciate the level of education they provide. It is a very good academic institution - nobody can deny that.\n\nI do have one major complaint about this school though. It's not a whole lot of fun, especially for a transfer student. Even for someone who went there all 4 years, I could see it being somewhat boring. The students can be pretty antisocial. The Price Center, which is the central part of campus with the food court and bookstore, etc, clears out pretty much when the sun goes down. It seems like most everyone attends class and that's it. There are frats and sororities that attempt to make the best out of a setting that doesn't even provide a frat row (no frat houses).

Not only is it a beautiful campus with interesting (to say the least) art and buildings, especially the signature building of Geisel Library, most of the professors I had were of extremely high caliber. I had some of the best teachers and mentors here ever.\n\nA little background on me: I attended 6th College (second class, w00t!) and graduated in 2007 with a BS in Biochemistry/Cell Biology and a minor in Health Care Social Issues. I lived on campus all 4 years, with 2 years in Pepper Canyon (now called Sixth College Apartments), 1 year in Marshall Lowers, and 1 year in International House - Kathmandu. I'd have to say my last year in I-House was the best year of my life and the most fun and culturally rewarding. I highly recommend everyone try to get in at least a semester there.\n\nI also studied abroad in Korea at Yonsei University via EAP. Studying abroad is another thing I'd highly recommend everyone do while still a student. It's NOT the same as traveling for vacay! It's way better!\n\nThe food is pretty good once you feel your way around. I loved the breakfast burritos and smoothies at OVT, the stirfry and cornbread at Muir, the salad bar at Warren, and spending my extra mealpoints on appliances and other junk at Earl's Place (could shop some Costco products via the website too). I understand that there are even more places you can shop and spend your mealpoints at now...*jealous*\n\nI got involved in a lot of clubs, most actively in InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Golden Key International Honor Society, and InSight Pre-Optometry Club. I did some fun stuff for credit like Teams in Engineering Service. I think it was really these extracurricular activities that enriched my time at UCSD so much.\n\nSan Diego and La Jolla are such a great place to live. There's endless things to do! And even without a car, you could still walk to the beach in 15 min or go to the cliffs in less. Nothing like watching the sunset after class. =)\n\nI'm really proud of UCSD and my education there, and I could say a lot more...but words would never encompass everything.

It's time to make a lot of money, bling it up, and head on over to your high school reunion and make those jocks-turned-losers who made fun of you back then feel like complete shit. Don't forget to wow that highscool crush who denied you before by whisking him/her away in your private helicopter.\nUnfortunately i won't be doing any of this myself because i am a literature major...bwaa bwaa. I'll be the guy at the bar getting wasted off of vodka and tonics. Oops. \nIf you're an average person like me, UCSD can be somewhat overwhelming. I transferred from a community college one year ago (after spending five years there because i pretty much slacked the whole time) and had a hard time adjusting. Here's are a few reasons why: \n\nClasses - So, that 18-week semester is pretty crazy, huh? You're pulling your hairs because you want this nightmare to be over, right? Well, here's what would happen if you complained about this to any of the 110 pound, scrawny little guys or girls buzzing around UCSD  - roundhouse kick right to the face. You're bitchin about eighteen week semesters? Well, we have to deal with ten week QUARTERS, with TWICE as much work. So there. \nPeople get so worked up about their classes at UCSD that, on average, quite a number of students commit SUICIDE every year. I typically read about at least one every other quarter, that's how hardcore it is (although i would attribute it to stupidity more than anything). But as gnarly as these cons may be, the pros of the quarter system are also apparent. There is no time to screw around. You can't take breaks. So what happens? You actually become disciplined, and therefore you end up getting the most out of the classes. I'll admit that i'm still not keen about the quarter system, but the quality of the education as a result of it is top notch. \n\nSocial Life - I don't have to dwell too much on this subject. Everybody knows that your likely to find more better looking, more amicable people at a Starwars enthusiasts meeting rather than at UCSD. Yes, i'm a shallow prick, and therefore looks are important to me, but personality is also important, if not more, and i'll have to admit that the Tritonettes fail to impress in either regards. Sigh. \nPeople are so socially akward at UCSD that they even stiffen up when working in class groups. Out of most of them you wont hear a peep throughout the course of the entire class. \n\nMascot - This conversation has actually happened:\nInquirer- \"So, what's a Triton?\"\nMe - \"...um, have you seen the little mermaid?\"\nInquirer - \"yeah\"\nMe - \"(clear throat) Yeah, well, uh, its pretty much the guy from the little mermaid\"\nInquirer - \"Which guy?\"\nMe - \"You know, the dad...the merman.\"\nInquirer - \"Oh\"\nMe - \"Yeah\"\nAkward silence, followed by the soothing sounds of crickets. Fuck.\n\nSports - Word on the street is that we have a pretty decent baseball team. That's nice, and i maybe i would appreciate it more if it wasn't for the fact that i consider baseball to be the most boring sport on the planet. Maybe i'm just pissy because we don't have a football team. Give me a football team, and then we'll talk about sports at UCSD.\n\nBut as much as i've complained about UCSD, i think it's only fair to mention that nonetheless, it really is a good school. Students can't weasel their way doing the bare minimum, because they are actually challenged, and this translates to developing more effective life skills for later. If you can transcend the socially inept students, the drab imagery of endless eucalyptus forests riddled with big, ugly crows and lifeless concrete buildings, and the pressures of academia, then i think you'll find something special.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:02:38Z","yelp_user_id":"WAIG4NTjX4d3Q0tpwAk10A"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:31:22Z","date":"2011-11-05","review_id":"SgytNJxYVU4v-NXjepnVzQ","stars":5,"text":"I swear I've reviewed UC San Diego before...

People who go here will always describe it as \"chill\" - which is exactly what it is... just very laidback in all aspects. Personally, I love living in sunny San Diego! There are six different colleges in UCSD, which actually makes what would be a big and impersonal school feel more homey. Each college has its own Academic Advising office, cafeteria, dorms and apartments, etc. They actually do have their own \"personalities\" - Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, has more liberal arts/humanities type people, while Earl Warren is known for being less social with a lot of engineering majors.\n\nSports are a minor thing, besides say, water polo. We don't have a football team, so that kills any hope for school spirit. Plus, Greek life is weak at best. A lot of SoCal people go home on the weekends, so it generally turns into a dead campus. The thing about the party scene is that you have to look to find it - there are always going to be some people down to party, it's just not campus-wide. The campus security officers are a pain to deal with, since they're very uptight about drinking. It's best to go off campus so you won't get caught. There are also pretty much weekly shuttles to Tijuana, which always makes a fun night. UCSD is by no means a wild campus, but trips to TJ almost always are. Among other things, I've passed out on the lawn at the border and walked back with no shoes. (BE SAFE!) Other things we do on the weekend include beach trips, bussing to Pacific Beach/downtown, going to the casino, etc. There's a mall and a movie theater, both about 10 minutes away. Usually we party on Friday, recover from all the damage done on Saturday, and do something mellow on Sunday.\n\nUCSD is a highly ranked and respected school. However, we're really considered a research school - there's a good amount of professors who are famous researchers but are mind-numbingly boring in the lecture hall. But there are a handful of simply amazing professors who make up for the rest. I had to seriously convince myself not to sign up for a Latin language class, for which I had absolutely zero interest in and no use for, but I more or less in love with Professor Charles Chamberlain, also known as Greek God. If only all professors were as wonderful/brilliant/humble/charming/wise, I think I would be in love with school. I've also had my fair share of good and bad TAs - so there's no way to really judge them as a whole. The workload is not bad at all; compared to my friends at other UCs, I get away with doing relatively little.\n\nI'm not gonna lie; we aren't know for being an attractive student body. Thus they say that people develop \"triton eye\" - in which your standards are lowered the longer you're a student here. Kind of like beer goggles, but without the alcohol. It's a very friendly and inviting campus - people are always playing football or frisbee on the lawn, and on warm days people will study or tan on the grass. At night there'll sometimes be groups smoking hookah on the green. I'm personally not in any clubs because I find I have enough to do... but if you're interested in something there are pretty much clubs for everything from cars to community service to cultural associations.\n\nBasically, you have to seek out fun to have it, but if you find the right people, you'll have a good time - so don't let those \"UC Socially Dead\" rumors scare you too much. La Jolla is a beautiful place to go to college, and overall it's been a positive experience.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:29:35Z","yelp_user_id":"N8Y_vWT_e0-fJoGhBZ5UjA"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:01:57Z","date":"2008-03-17","review_id":"SLFTM9eoBBRFqK1lRRg19A","stars":5,"text":"So one acquaintance of mine referred to the architecture of this place as something along the lines of Disneyland.

I had the opportunity to use my workstudy to do research with a professor in the School of Medicine at the VA hospital. Several projects and published papers later, I was off to graduate school, for teaching nevertheless, from the opportunities that he had given me here. \n\nThe teaching quality, at least at the undergraduate level, can vary widely depending on dept to dept. I felt that the biology, chem, and physics depts could have done a better job to engage the students in practical uses of concepts learned in lectures. The lab courses were definitely more interesting and challenging for me. The lower division calculus and differential equations classes were equally interesting and challenging. Do take the time to take classes outside of your major. I took an upper division music course devoted entirely on analysis of Bach's work and loved it even though it required me to read many scores during the weekends and see how Bach thinks in his music. The best courses I took was from the Teacher Education Program (TEP). They were more organized and higher quality than the ones I had for my MAT at Cornell. As you might expect from a public school, the lectures can be as large as 300 students, but the labs and TEP courses are small in the 30-40s. \n\nLike many science majors, I once considered medicine as a option and still think it is a very noble profession to pursue, but it is not for me. As for advice, do it because you enjoy working and help people and the knowledge and not because it having a lab coat makes you above others. Definitely consider NOT majoring in a science and pursue other practical interests during your undergraduate years (though I would stay away from majoring in communications...you CAN actually find and pursue an legitimate major in four years, can't you?). In medical school, you will have learned all the science you need to practice medicine. \n\nTry to stay away from the \"food\" served at the cafeteria as much as possible, although the High Price Center doesn't help except for the Jamba Juice. \n\nBe sure to live life by balancing your fun and studies!

I guess I would take off a star because they don't have a football team...but that's what I have USC for! =)","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:33:44Z","yelp_user_id":"i_jyzR3NhOldcHa2K1UqtQ"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:36:20Z","date":"2012-01-13","review_id":"TYYz42tPQxb0zhBhC0fEdQ","stars":1,"text":"First, all the stuff in the \"Lilly S.\" review is accurate and perhaps too kind; I will avoid restating her observations although they bear repeating.  \n   Be Aware: \nA)  Among the UC campuses, UCSD has a unique group of 6-'Colleges' that each paint different requirements regarding the undergraduate G.Ed undertakings. One requires 'U.S. History', one requires almost a year more of G.Ed, one requires foreign language, one 'artsy', two allow 'dual-major' courses to substitute for what other Colleges call a 'well rounded' education (and yeah, the students coming out of this are dumb as stones outside of their Major's).\n   This '6-college' system means there are double and triple the number of 'advisers' on this campus relative to other UC campuses of equal or larger size. Each 'College' is a self-preserving entity on it's own, and some are much better than others. You would think, from the literature, you can CHOOSE which college suits you... not so; the Catalog tells you less about them then this paragraph. (When you figure out you've been hosed, it may be too late; they don't allow easy transfer to another College). As a 'dorm-mother' function, these Colleges rate better; why the serve a dual role is beyond comprehension. \nB)  Transfer students (largely from J.C.'s) can benefit from 'Reciprocity' for eliminating the G.Ed requirement  IF  they have completed ALL the J.C.'s G.Ed. requirements and have a 'letter' stating same. Inter-UC transfers MUST do the same, but other UC's DO NOT create a curriculum for 'transfers' that the JC's do, so good luck with a 'letter.'\nC)   Item B does NOTHING for transfer' students Major (the department that accepts you), but that all varies from Major to Major. IF your Major is classic (and historically established, such as English, Communication, languages, Psych, etc. and other areas that lead to being a fun Barista) then you may matriculate just fine; you are 'another brick in the wall'. Note:  you must 'Petition' for each undergrad class in your major in which you seek equivalence.\n  BUT (a big Butt): in the Sciences, esp. Engineering, there are extremely FEW equivalence that can be easily approximated;  so you'll find yourself REPEATING concepts/classes yet again. Worse: many departments stack the courses on Tuesdays and Thursdays (esp. at Jacob's school of Engineering), so there is NO WAY to take both upper division and lower division classes at the same time.  All transfer students to Jacob's, even those from Stanford or other U.C.'s should expect to add TWO YEARS because of inability to provide  line-by-line equivalent class syllabuses.  The advisers at Jacob's have NO JUICE; all  they can do is poorly advise you, and tell you they have been working for YEARS to pressure the faculty to spread classes into Mondays and Fridays, so that conflicting courses aren't such a problem. Neither the Chancellor, various Deans have any influence on the abysmal system portrayed above; and most just keep their head in the sand. \n   Similar to almost all U.C. engineering schools, MANY students are angry and self-serving, with a Cantonese-Kalifornian background. Students outside of the Engineering Majors tend to have much more free-time, and are happier here, and jobless after graduation. The Bio-sciences future has also dimmed considerably, unless your goals are MUCH MORE education after a B.S. \n\n   La Jolla, and the 'University City' area has criminal rings that prey on the off-campus housing/apartment areas. Sport motorcycle theft is the highest in the U.S., even parking them on Campus is not safe at all. (stolen bikes can be found with a new number in front of the old, and sold as new in Mexico City I'm told). There are no street lights in La Jolla.  The UCSD campus, located on an otherwise un-buildable hill, is surrounded by 6-lane Freeways; Fraternity and Sorority houses are illegal; bottom line: \"there is no there, there.\"","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:11:35Z","yelp_user_id":"Bz6tbCsRLowVSBFtVg1G7A"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:51:42Z","date":"2008-03-29","review_id":"u_AEul45R-kbZyoWF4rZQQ","stars":3,"text":"Okay, let's be honest.. \nAcademics wise, yes, UCSD is a great school.  You will get an exemplary education, especially in any form of science.  I've never really had a professor that has let me down, although I probably have been pretty lucky.  Classes are HARD, but managable if you keep up and actually put an effort in (in the sciences at least). \nThe location is amazzzzing. La Jolla is in an incredibly beautiful place and I'm convinced that San Diego is definitely one of the best cities in the world.  The campus itself has some interesting architecture, some good, some obviously outdated, but overall a nice place to be.\nIf you're looking for a social life, this is NOT THE PLACE TO LOOK. People, in general, are not very friendly. Or attractive. Although, if you look in the right places, you'll find the right people. It's a rough adjustment if you're not used to such anti social people, but you'll probably find your way.\nThe beach is down the street, which makes it a dream college for me. And although the down sides to UCSD made me absolutely despise the place my first year, you figure out whats really great and learn to love that and find the good things in this socially inept school.

I mean, 88% of the girls are in the closet freaks who pretend they're totally innocent, and 98.2% of the guys have never touched a girl before. \n\nAcademics:\nThere are some really amazing professors here that make class fun. But there are also not so great ones. This is definitely a study school! so be prepared to study study study!\nAIP (academic internship program) is VERY helpful and useful in helping you secure an internship and gain experience in a field you're interested in. I think AIP is one of the biggest PROS about UCSD. the AIP office workers are super nice and helpful. so go and take advantage of that! \n\nSocial life: \nDon't expect one. You have to really search hard to find people you can click with. I've never met so many socially awkward people in my life. I think a lot of the students here were just SO smart in high school they didn't get a chance to develop socially. \n\nthe GIRLS- there are definitely some very attractive girls here. Maybe not ALL OVER campus, but here and there. like 2 out of 40 girls. There are also a handful of ugly ones too who think they're super hot and walk around with their noses in the air. But don't worry, with time you'll develop Triton goggles and everyone's ugliness will seem very normal.\n\nthe GUYS- so. awkward. so so so. awkward. physically, 98% of them look the same. UCSD sweatshirt, high water pants, and tennis shoes. Personality-wise, there are some SUPER funny ones and A LOT of immature ones. They will talk about porn and butts and boobs like it's the COOLEST THING EVER. I think they just need to get laid and move on with life. Girls, don't expect to meet your Romeo here. \n\nParking:\nYou can get ticketed for ANYTHING. UCSD wants to make their students poorer than ever. I've never gotten a parking ticket here, BUT I've known a lot of people who have for things like not \"turning your wheels\" when you're parked on a flat surface. Oh wait, they claimed it was a \"hill\". Also, they're constantly reducing the number of student parking spots and raising the prices as well! Some of the apartments around campus give really stupid parking tickets too. Even to people who DO have the right to park where they're parked. Anyway, I know it's your job and all, but GET A LIFE and stop ticketing people for STUPID little things that even YOU wouldn't know you're doing wrong if it were YOU. \n\nLa Jolla:\nIt's a rich conservative little town. The beach is nice and peaceful, but that's really the only interesting thing there. If you want to have fun, GET OUT OF THERE. It only takes about 5-20 minutes to drive outta there and into some other places of San Diego like Hillcrest, PB, downtown SD, Mira Mesa, Clairemont, La Mesa, El Cajon, Carlsbad, etc etc etc. \nI'm from San Diego and it BUGS me when people complain about how \"boring\" it is in SD.

Most classes, in the day and I am sure currently, were not easy especially the upper level ones.  I also recall that, although I lived off campus and not in an on campus dorm, that UCSD was definitely not the \"party\" school that say, SDSU or Chico is/was. Also, I do know that it is very difficult to attend UCSD as the standards for admission are much more difficult. \n\nNow the true purpose for my review. I needed to meet a friend at the Cognitive Science Building. No problem I thought, I went to UCSD and how much could it have changed. Well, as I ended up wandering around the campus muttering to myself that I was indeed lost, I came upon a familiar building and thought, \"yes! The third college administration building. I went to Third College. I will go in and ask directions.\"  As I approached the building I say a large sign, \"Thurgood Marshall\" with a smaller plaque that indicated it was formerly known as Third College. WTF ... was it like The Artist formerly known as Prince? Why the name change? Likely a donation ... So feeling a bit fatigued from my 20 mile hike and feeling old as I remembered that my mom said the hospital I was born in no longer existed and now my college was renamed, I decided to buck up and ask someone where the Cognitive Science Building was.  Wandering in and out of buildings and past numerous lecture halls, I could NOT find anyone who was not busy chattering on a cell phone or listening to an iPod.  Finally, I came upon a sweet unsuspecting girl who nicely guided me to the building.  After visiting my friend, I left and realized I had walked past the fkn building 45 minutes earlier. Sigh ... Walking back through UCSD and down the pathway near the library, one will always encounter one or more of the following: religious pamphlets being handed out, invites to bars and bands, rantings and political posters about the demise of Israel, Africa, amongst other countries, pro abortion advocates, anti abortion advocates, in addition to a variety of fraternities and sororities selling food to help their houses (e.g., Korean BBQ, pancakes, hotdogs, etc ..). There cannot be any starving students at $3-5 a healthy plate for those causes.  Wandering down the pathway, I also admire that although UCSD is still filled with students from many different cultures, the attire has drastically changed. Yes, there are those who wear traditional clothing from their country of origin, but shirtless males, women and men in board shorts, jeans, layered clothes, and lastly the attire akin to El Cajon Blvd. and I don't mean the johns. UCSD people watching is always a treat.  I know what the clich\u00e9 \"the more things change, the more they remain the same\" means.  Although this campus is quite a bit larger than I recall, the cultural diversity of the campus is definitely still in existence.  Take a walk through. It is a must.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:47:54Z","yelp_user_id":"60hAJJcv1_KhdOBC9P-CBw"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:12:46Z","date":"2010-11-04","review_id":"UOpILXo8BSUqLjAK1IjH-w","stars":3,"text":"The undergraduate population, overall, is pretty pathetic.

Here's my impressions of the 2 1/2 years I spent there...\n\nSocial Scene - Like many people say, the social scene here is pretty blah. Someone joked UCSD stands for \"University that is Completely Socially Dead\". For some people, a good Friday night is playing Tekken with some dorm-mates. But I'd be lying if I said that socializing is improssible, but I didn't really get much mileage by socializing within the VERY cliquish clubs like NSU, KSA, etc. You just have to work harder here to find fun people than at other schools.\n\nCampus - Parking near the core of campus is neigh impossible, even at 7 in the morning! Forget about Gillman! Regents is probably the best place to park, the shuttles there come at reasonably brisk pace. If you're a commuter, rushing to class late is going to be a PITA. This school is huge!\nHowever some parts of the campus are very nice. I used to like to study in the Grove Cafe, or in one of the lounges near the top of Tioga Hall in Muir where you can see the cliff-studded Pacific Coast while hang-gliders coast along the waves. The top of the Geisel isn't too bad as well.\n\nFood - Like most campus food, it ranges from mediocre to putrid. Some of my better dining experiences were in Muir's cafeteria and \"El Mercado.\" Price Center, or Pricey Center as everyone likes to call it, is nothing but chain junk, and crowded to boot. I did enjoy \"The Art of Espresso\", a coffee cart next to Mandeville. AoE has a very funny and cool staff, and some awesome espresso drinks too. Even if you live on the other side of campus, they're worth a trip.\n\nClasses - Lower Divison classes, like in other UC schools, suck hard. You feel like you're in high school and the teachers are really patronizing. I've had ups and downs with the upper divison classes, but the Poli Sci department at UC definately had some good variety. If you're a UCSD student you have to take a Victor Magagna class, even if you're not a Poli-Sci major. The man was one of the best lecturers I've seen.\nThe language programs at UC however are lame. I just gave up on them and did tutoring with a student who did private Japanese lessons.\nAlso, class sizes are LARGE. You need to be very motivated to meet with your professor because they'll likely be hard to catch. Most of the times you'll be talking to a Teacher's Assistant (TA). Some of them can be real stuck-up and snooty. I can only think of two TA's who I actually liked at UC.\n\nI'd also like to note that the International Center is really great and that Bill Clabby is a super guy. If you want to do some study abroad, he's an awesome fellow to talk to.\n\nOverall: It can be sometimes daunting and isolating at UCSD, but you can get a lot out of this school if you apply yourself and are motivated, no matter what field you are in. Being a lower divison student here is very tough and I personally think UCSD is a good school to transfer into, but I might be biased since that is how I went to this school. Since UCSD is a big name in research, the worst thing you could do is not take advantage of this place's reputation.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:55:24Z","yelp_user_id":"pan7O0850E0fEImwyH2WeQ"},{"business_id":"_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:31:12Z","date":"2010-05-03","review_id":"WBEUmkdtitzvExpgdl584w","stars":2,"text":"YUCK!

In general, the university has improved in many arenas since I first stepped foot onto campus in 2006. The University Center/Student Services Center has doubled in size and resources, the shuttle system has become a bit more streamlined, and they've built housing for transfer students, with a new sports bar and coffee shop nearby. I lived on campus in my freshmen year and all I can say is that all the new on-campus residents are so spoiled with all their amenities and better food! \n\nAs for student life itself, I'd say that this is a great institution to attend if you love studying or if you love student organizations/clubs. \n\nWe have top-notch academic resources on campus, from science labs to social science field research. The university is also well connected in San Diego, so there are many opportunities for some really great internships (I was able to secure one with the American Heart Association as I am going into public health). There are also cool novelty classes ranging from \"Anatomy of a Rockstar\" to \"Psychology of Human Sexuality.\" There really isn't much guidance when it comes to choosing a field of study, but once you do a little self searching and discover what you want to do with your life, there are plenty of academic resources available for you to utilize. \n\nBut as for me, I love the latter. My experience at UCSD has been shaped by my involvement with various student organizations, as opposed to my academic studies (sorry, parents..). While I'd agree that the campus as a whole doesn't quite scream \"partaay!\" there are many opportunities to pursue your non-academic interests, and make some great friends along the way. We have hundreds of organizations on campus, and if you don't like any of them, you can even start your own. I'd have to say that I met about 90% of my friends through being involved in student organizations.

The theatre department at UCSD is one of the best in the country and taking a couple of theatre classes is a great way to meet friendly peeps because the classes are so small. \n\n2) Skateboard on campus - I so miss skating on campus while listening to my I-Pod.

There are social people at UCSD, but you may have to make an effort to find them. If you're struggling in a class go to office hours. Many professors are really helpful and friendly one on one. If you're really scared to talk to a professor, or you need help with an essay or assignment go to your TA's office hours since they'll be grading your work in most cases. Use the career services center (and Port Triton) to get a job when you're in school or when you graduate. Also, attend some of the career services center programs about interviewing, writing resumes, etc. If you're applying to graduate school they'll read your personal statement for you and give you recommendations to improve it.

Since I have been attending UCSD I have learned so much. Professors are among the most intelligent in their fields and so easy to approach. They may seem intimidating but they are so eager to have students go talk to them during office hours and make you feel very welcome. It IS a VERY competitive school so be prepared for that. As for all those people who complain about the UCSD social life, it is because they are the ones who choose it to be that way. College is what you make of it, if you are looking to party and have a good time, trust me, you wouldn't have any difficulty at UCSD.

It is for MANY MANY reasons! \n\nLet me just start by saying I use this station just about every other weekend this year when I go to Boston! \n\nIts location is GREAT! Because you dont need to drive into Boston to get here! HUGE plus for me! I hate the traffic Boston sometimes offers. The station also has a lot of parking. I find it best to park up on the 3rd level and just park in a corner! This way its easy to find your car and the 3rd level all most always seems empty to me. So if you worry about your car getting hit or bumped. This is some advice for you! \n\nParking here is very cheap! $7 a day or $8 a night! I dont think there is a better deal than this in the area. I know in Boston the cheapest I could find it was $15 a night. So being at about half the price you dont really need to think about it! \n\nThe tickets for the train are also very reasonable! You can do it a few different ways! One you could get a card and load up some money and pay $1.75 a scan. Not to bad! The second choice you can do and get a 7 day pass for a cheap $15. The monthly card goes for around $60 if I remember right. I always end up getting the 7 day pass. I can easily use over $15 in one weekend just going back and worth in the city! So if your there for a weekend that's probably your best bet. Then you dont need to keep refilling the card! Also keep in mind all of the options are also good for the bus lines as well and ANY color train route! \n\nThe only thing about this station that gets to me as I'm sure you can read in other reviews. The bathrooms are bad! I dont think they are ever cleaned. Even the sink is nasty. Stay clear of this. Just go down and get on your train! Wait it out until your next stop! \n\nSo over all the station is very helpful for parking and tickets for public transportation. Its not over prices and I have never ran into a problem on the T. Trains always seem to be on time and one is always sitting there when I get down there! So if your going to Boston or anywhere the T can bring you, go here! Just make sure you can hold your self if you need a rest room!\n\nVery very solid 4/5!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:48:49Z","yelp_user_id":"g45Xe2AE6sA_SclipUWVYg"},{"business_id":"_0L2QGLqWVoAWrSczWFOXQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:34:31Z","date":"2010-12-11","review_id":"9c4vjVjsFWYwoCF-ILnxEw","stars":4,"text":"Alewife is a great station.

My favorite is Consiglios in New Haven, CT.  I just graduated from RPI this semester (Dec. '11) and finally tried this restaurant.  It is the last white tablecloth restaurant left in Troy and it really shines.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside and it is no in the best area of Troy, but it is great.  The inside feels a Manhattan restaurant.  It feels like the restaurant in the movie \"Dinner Rush.\"  \n\nOn to the food.  I have had the Bolognese which was I was completely unimpressed with (hence the four stars instead of five).  It was chopped up meatballs in their house marinara instead of a stewed beef, veal, pork, and/or sausage sauce with a couple of cans of tomato sauce like I grew up with and found at other top-notch Italian restaurants.  I would not recommend this dish.\n\nThe two times succeeding my first visit I ordered the chicken parmigiana.  It was thick for what I am used to, very thick in fact.  However, it was properly cooked and the most tender breaded chicken I have had.  The breading was good Italian bread crumbs cooked in good olive oil.  The house sauce is quite good.  \n\nThe portions are huge, really huge.  Most restaurants give you one chicken breast filleted into two pieces and then breaded and fried.  They give you two full chicken breasts and pasta.  If you order a pasta dish, it comes with an entire pound of pasta.  The prices are high, but you get a lot of food.  \n\nThe atmosphere has a local elegant feel.  It is a mix between my local pizza place and an elegant restaurant.  Actually, when I was there last, there were two wedding proposals (The guy hid the ring under a pile of fried calamari).  Service was fine.  It is a relaxed dining experience (i.e. slow).  If you are with family or friends it goes by quickly.  Delicious bread comes to the table upon arrival and the wine list is extensive (for Troy at least, Spago had a text book for a wine list, so not quite that long).  \n\nI liked this restaurant a lot.  It is traditional Italian fare that I love.  It is not the nuvo-Italian restaurants folks like in NYC (such as Babbo or Circo), but I like traditional better anyway.   It is a must for RPI families, a business lunch, and perhaps a proposal.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:50:02Z","yelp_user_id":"QEq_NdZePer4HOCZSR7Oug"},{"business_id":"_21B4W3qjnl8lcxDYJE3kw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:00:16Z","date":"2010-08-23","review_id":"3w02bsqRiwwDo66-DdycFQ","stars":2,"text":"Ok, so I'm comparing Lo Porto's to my favorites such as Cafe Capriccio, Cafe Italia and Lombardo's.

Ok, so it was included BUT...I asked if their house vinaigrette was home made and I was told yes.  My salad came out and it was standard iceburg with a bit of romaine and BOTTLED Italian dressing!  There's no confusing home made for the bottled crap that I hate so...much!\n\nThe pasta...over cooked and literally about 2 lbs of the stuff per dish. I think that's a huge waste of food.

But it was only standard fare that would have sat in my fridge festering until the next time I cleaned out the fridge...\n\nThe Veal Parm..super flat paper thin piece of meat pounded so much it actually hung over the plate.  It looked inpressive when it came out with it's 2 lbs of pasta but it was all breading and the veal was indistinguishable from anything  that could have been pounded that flat and thin.   I know it was veal but mystery meat comes to mind when you really can't tell! \n\nThat's my experience.  salad dressing from a bottle on iceburg lettuce and highly breaded  \"paper\" veal with no flavor and too much over cooked pasta.\n\nAnd the place is chopped up into very small, odd dinning areas.

I asked my Residence Director to recommend a place that would impress my uncle that was coming up for Family Weekend.  Well, it sure did the job. I still remember what my uncle said after dinner was over: \"He's been to Italian places all over the world, but the food here was PHENOMENAL!\" And so the bar was set. For the last 17 years Lo Porto's which is hidden away in upstate New York on a small street in downtown Troy would forever be against what all restaurants would be compared. And I've been coming back up here for the last 17 years even though I have lived near New York City since the late 90's.  My usual table is the one over-looking the balcony (ask for Table #7 when reserving a table for 2).\n\nSo, my wife and a friend decided to go there after heading up to RPI for alumni weekend.  On Saturdays, the restaurant opens at 5:00 PM, so we made a reservation for that time.  When we arrived we told the hostess that we had a reservation and she began to lead us upstairs past my usual table on the balcony and into their backroom. We had a reservation for 3, so I can understand why they couldn't seat us at Table #7, but there were plenty of other tables on the second level and couldn't understand why they were hiding us all the way in the back. When I asked the hostess why she was seating us all the way in the back, at first she told me that the tables had been reserved. I then reminded her that WE had a reservation ourselves and that we had driven about 3 hours up there from NYC and could have anywhere but in advance we had chosen to go there.\n\nI should probably make mention, that this was not the first time that I had gone up there with my wife. About 3 years ago I went up there with my wife for another alumni weekend event and I was very excited to show her my \"hidden secret\" in Troy. Unfortunately, that night was less than spectacular and my wife could not understand why I always carried on making such a big thing about this place. I assured her that it must have been an off night and could only hope that she'd give this place another try.\n\nFast forward to the present day. We ordered the Escargot Maison ($12.95) - Escargot Stuffed Mushrooms Caps in a Zesty Cream Sauce with Garlic. However, the description fails to mentions the fresh diced tomatoes and capers interspersed throughout the dish. The 3 of us devoured the appetizer and it was every bit as good as I remembered.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the restaurant's signature dish, Veal Scorsese ($24.95). My wife was indecisive of what she wanted to order and did not see Penne Vodka on the menu, so the waitress suggested that she could have my side pasta which was included with the veal and that the chef could prepare it with their cognac sauce which is similar to vodka sauce. How could anyone turn down an offer like that?\n\nWhen the meals came, my veal was as excellent as I had always remembered it to be. Even my wife admitted that her Ziti in Cognac Sauce with mushrooms and prosciutto was as well prepared as any Penne Vodka she had anywhere else.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the portions here are insane and you will definitely be wrapping up part of your entree to bring home.\n\nThe big surprise for us came when we received our check. The menu lists the Veal Scorsese ($24.95), but the check showed the charge for that portion of the meal as $32.90. When I asked the waitress how much extra it cost for the Cognac Sauce she confirmed that it was $7.95 and said that it was because it was cooked to order. At that price I probably would have just asked her if she could prepare a 1/2 order of pasta for my wife and still give me the side of pasta that was included with my meal. The problem I have is that she did not tell me about that the additional charge was so exorbitant.\n\nTo close this up, on this visit the food was much better than our last visit. Good enough to convince my wife that we should come back here again on our next trip to RPI.  The biggest problem that I had was with the service. I have seen prices increase by over 60% in the time that I have been coming here. This is not the fault of the chef/owner as price changes can be attributed to inflation and the increase of his materials. Unfortunately, I can't find any reason for the consistent drop in service. I did appreciate that our waitress asked us if we had tickets to a show and were in a hurry. However, I could not understand why the hostess tried to hide us away in the back when nobody else was in there. We stayed there long enough to see her put a few couples that were 40 years older than us in our surrounding seats on the balcony. It would have been nice if she mentioned about the near $8 surcharge on the pasta, there should never be surprises when the check arrives. A bad start and a bad finish to what could have otherwise have been a better rated evening.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:40:55Z","yelp_user_id":"LDtlPQmus1_knyGSuI-bgQ"},{"business_id":"_21B4W3qjnl8lcxDYJE3kw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:08:54Z","date":"2009-07-20","review_id":"Nyfx39QJz457QKQIdf5Zow","stars":3,"text":"Look, I am sad to post that Lo Porto's probably won't be an Italian restaurant I'm coming back any time soon. Sad because for so long it had been on our list of places to try in Troy, a place that everyone said we simply must try - and it didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nI don't really have any complaints about the food. It's flavourful, hearty Italian fare. The salads were great, and the bread was delicious (though I should have read Ticia's review more carefully - I didn't realize you had to special request oil, so we just got butter). I had an eggplant parm that was lovely but could have held off on the cheese, and my husband had a seafood dish that was loaded very generously with scallops.\n\nHere comes the '.... but.' When we walked in to the somewhat empty room without a reservation, I was surprised at the instantly frosty reaction from the hostess. Like lullabylove x, we got shafted in this table by the kitchen, where there was huge amounts of traffic from the staff.  I felt uncomfortable the whole night as it was difficult to relax with someone brushing by every five seconds. It sucked. I also had the distinct impression if I was thirty years older I would have been treated better.

Hmm- their prices aren't high enough?  But it was worth it, because their marinara is good.

She listens and really cares about your well-being.  The woman is simply off the hook as a premium care giver!  I've been going to her for almost 18 years and now my daughter is her patient too.  Nothing but the best for my family!!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:40:36Z","yelp_user_id":"Eva274V0UhvqY4owmBEu9w"},{"business_id":"_2Aldrv7Yny4F63_ePN0Zw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:14:35Z","date":"2010-08-12","review_id":"VbPf9aX5GEg6A4eJCRKFOA","stars":5,"text":"Seriously, Dr. Lannin is amazing in so many ways.

I promise, I will try it again and maybe try something less conventional. Because last night, the over-all impression of the food, was...eh, ok. I'll head to Pizza n Such next, as usual, thanks. But hey, some places deserve at least two rounds and this is one of them. I promise, I *will* try again. \n\nWe had a cheese pizza - my kids loved it! To impress my 9 year old son is quite a job when it comes to pizza. He likes Ledo's, the REAL one, in College Park, MD and Pizza n Such. Well, he also likes Domino's Cheese Pizza, double cheese, but he knows as well as I do, that may as well be \"McPizza\" (anyone actually remember that, lol?). Anyway, it was under cooked, floppy. Now I always reheat pizza in my cast iron skillet anyway, but this was a NEED, in order to get it fully done and crispy. The dough was cooked, but it was white still, under-side and the edges. And VERY little sauce. I wasn't sure there *was* sauce at first, there was so little. But once crisped up, re cooked and doused with Italian seasoning, lol, it was pretty good. I must try other types there. Maybe the gluten-free is good! I WILL find out. \n\nNow if any one of you follow me, you know I am a huge meatball sub fan. I consider myself a connoisseur, lol. I LOVE a good meatball sub with cheese - and have been in serious mourning since Federico's in Claremont closed, what, 25 years ago? Seriously, people. I can imagine that taste still, to this day. Sorry, I will wax nostalgic elsewhere! But I have yet to find a replacement. This is not one that even comes close. This reminded me of Subway's meatball sub. The rolls are so...prefab. And chewy - like underdone dough can be. Like par-cooked! That's' it! It was like it was par-cooked. Meh. The meatballs - too few of them, though the taste was decent, I admit. Not enough sauce either. Nope. No more meatballs there at least for me. Boo. Maybe on the pizza, since they were slices. Thinly. \n\nI also sampled the turkey sandwich that has cranberry sauce on it. That was good! Now the bread was still an issue, but the sauce was full of fruit, the Dijon mustard was a nice kick to the break up the sweetness of the cranberry sauce and it all went together well. But pardon me for being a snobette, but it was a SANDWICH and not particularly unique in style. In fact, Vons used to have one at their deli counter that was GREAT! This? Was good, yes. I took the stuff out of the bread and ate it separately. I'll indulge in bread - I love good bread - but I can leave the calories behind when the bread is just a way to hold ingredients together. \n\nThe best thing was the garlic bread! Still, underdone, but the flavor was great, my kids loved it to bits and I admit to snagging a half piece...just for the sake of the review, you know. Really. Yup ;) It comes with a little cup of their red sauce - which I have to say, IS good. Just use more on the pizza, folks! I mean, sure *my* sauce is better. Ahem. But this was a good, strong flavor and the texture was thick, but not gloppy. I hate too thick or too thin sauce...this sauce was juuuuust right! I give it my Goldilocks seal of approval. \n\nThe Greek salad...oh MY when will restaurants actually make a real Greek salad, and not Greek-inspired? Just call it Greek-inspired, people! You are giving a false impression as to what a real Greek salad is! And not just Zpizza...oh, no! Some places are better than others, but Zpizza is pretty much took inaccurate to higher level than other places that make good \"Greek\" salads (but still are not autherntic). This was a bunch of Spring mix greens, with some slicked up Kalamata olives, here and there...some feta...I found some, I found some! Then few slices of red onion and a balsamic vinagarette. It's not that it was a bad salad - it wasn't. But I think there should at least be more of the items that would help Greek it up a bit. Oh, some cucumbers and tomatoes, too, to be fair. \n\n\nIt's just an ok pizza place. but I LOVE what they are attempting wiht the ingredients. The organics, the grass fed cows from Wisconsin, and the meats with out garbage in them and the different crust option? Excellent! But they even say, \"If it doesn't crunch, it's not a pizza!\" Well, I guess I didn't have a pizza then, huh, folks? Ah, well...  \n\nI, like I said, will indeed try it again at some point...perhaps after their beer and wine license comes through ;) (it's on the way, btw, all, so sit tight!)","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:58:27Z","yelp_user_id":"dM_JJarNKBWgQWPKpU0kWw"},{"business_id":"_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:35:08Z","date":"2012-04-13","review_id":"oA-2YR__3OhNM0Hd2dz21A","stars":4,"text":"We ordered the gluten free California version with chicken sausage.

The service wasn't great but I just let it go since they were still trying to find their groove due to being new. I ordered a mushroom veggie burger, and the patty is basically made of black beans and mushrooms....a huge disappointment since the menu doesn't give a description or warning. If I would have known I wouldn't have ordered the burger. I typically order veggie burgers when I eat out and I would have to say their burger wasn't good and the taste was very odd. My son ordered chicken strips and fries. The chicken was DRY and had a hint of fish taste, I can only assume fish was fried in the same fryer prior to the chicken? The fries were excellent and they were definitely the highlight of the meal. \n\nOur second visit (today) was really not a a good experience as far as service goes. We arrived for a late lunch around 2:30. Since it is a seat yourself establishment we sat at one of the 2 available tables toward the front of the restaurant. 10 minutes after we arrived another family walked in and sat at the table next to us...they were waited on immediately while we just sat and hoped someone would notice we were sitting there with no drinks or food. A few minutes later a man (who didn't look like a server) walked over and asked if we had been helped. My husband asked if they had Stella on tap and he said no and named the beers they have on tap, in addition to saying we have a whole bunch of bottle beers so go over to the bar and take a look at what we have. Have they ever heard of a beer list??? I ordered a Belvedere and 7-up, to my surprise they do not have belvedere so I went with Kettle One. After a very LONG wait he walked back to the table with my son's soda and husband's beer, um were was my drink? Oh I'm sorry he said but I forgot what you ordered. Terrible! He returned with my drink and a young lady came out and we ordered our food. \n\nWhile we waited for our food we had the pleasure (or not) of watching and listening to the most obnoxious drunk I have ever witnessed. I was actually embarrassed for him for being so drunk and loud and for the bar tender that continued to serve him while he was offending the other customers in the restaurant. \n\nWhen our food arrived our server brought out my garden salad (no dressing or fork), margarita pizza, in addition to my husband and son's french fries (no hamburger). I understand she only has two hands and can only carry so much at one time, but the amount of time we had to wait for the remainder of our order was ridiculous. I didn't want to start eating my pizza until the guys got their burgers so by the time the burgers came out my pizza was cold and I couldn't eat my salad because I didn't have a fork or salad dressing. \n\nThe food was actually very good! I can honestly say when we finally had the chance to eat we couldn't complain about the quality. However, I will think twice about returning because the service was extremely poor.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:28:14Z","yelp_user_id":"oN4-V6urowAXS464HdNZkg"},{"business_id":"_3cAeuaKocR1L5nLJITs7Q","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:31:51Z","date":"2012-08-10","review_id":"e9BuX4JDFS5Ocv_dq9-PNw","stars":4,"text":"As it's name suggests, this bar and grill is situated on the San Luis Obispo Creek and offers up some delicious island fare.

The server greeted us in pretty short order and informed us he had someone he was training that evening. We've all been the \"new guy/girl\" so we joked with her to put her at ease. \n\nThe lead guy took our drink orders and she came back with them right away.

I've had fish tacos all over the county and I would put these at a 7. The tasty salsa that came with them was a bit spicy for me (I'm a wuss when it comes to that anyway so...) but very good none the less. My wife had the Chicken Pesto sandwich and the only complaint she has was the bread was a little tough due to the toasting of it. Other than that she compared it to the ones she's had at Lombardi's in Cambria and that's saying something. My dad had the fish and chips and, since our area is fairly well known for it's seafood, his expectations were rightfully high. Well the fish came out and looked like it was a step above the Fillet o Fish Patties. Dad's review reflected the same. Chewy. \n\nBy the time we were ready for the check the place had filled up and the wait staff was busy so it took a little while but eventually we got it.

Ahi tuna with lettuce, cilantro, guacamole and lime wrapped in a flour tortilla. Reminded me of the sisig tacos from yummy food trucks in SF that I'm so very fond of. LOVES!

My dad ordered this so I had a tiny bite of it as well. The beef patty was pretty good, a little on the dry side though but I could easily tell that it was charcoal grilled because it had that distinct fragrance of charcoal on it.

And then there were these tiny, sinister-looking ceiling fans buzzing around the whole place, imminently ready to descend and cut me to pieces--ironically, these bothered me most of all.\n\nThese visits formed such a deep impression that I did not return until almost two decades later, when a friend needed to turn in a final lab report for a geology class at Amherst.  There I was astounded to find all my old nemeses disarmed of their former powers and housed in a gorgeous new building alongside oodles of geological specimens, all accompanied by informative labels.

Being the macho foodie that I am, I instantly decided we must try it so we could see just how bad this idea was.  We ordered and I proceeded to watch with gleeful horror as the cook pulled out this industrial size can of JIF (one of the sugariest, crappiest peanut butters out there) and adds it to the mix on the grill. We got the burgers (on plain ol' grocery-store sesame buns) and were fully ready to blast the heck out of this joint...when a miracle occurred. Yes, that burger was in fact a miracle. Somewhere along the way, the Jif had turned into pure magic and light, and my meal was now amazing. Holy crap. \n\nSo, while on the whole this place remains an average hometown diner - certainly wouldn't drive two hours for it alone - if I am back this way, I will be honored to take on the PBB once more :)","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:40:53Z","yelp_user_id":"QDuxhHkUuuY7zRWc2Trrdw"},{"business_id":"_3zpIUnDykKUAhcMxB2UgQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:56:21Z","date":"2012-07-29","review_id":"nEuGZZyZVFuJUgzrKSrvUA","stars":4,"text":"Good, friendly, quick service.

I was immediately greeted, but there was a line, so I was not serviced right away. The wait did not bother me, because I was too busy looking at the beautiful cupcakes in the display case, the catchy t-shirts for sell, and the fun yet elegant cupcake artwork that hung on the wall. And when it was my turn to order, it was my lucky day. They were having a sell: buy two, get one free. So, I bought two, and got one free of course. Overall, the atmosphere was great, the aroma even better, and the service was excellent. The only downfall was that they did not have enough vegan variety in the store. They have more variety for order, but not in the store. They only had Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes with vanilla or mocha frosting. I would have loved to try their Red Velvet Cupcake. Yum!\n\n\nTalk about rich. Talk about flavor. Talk about Vabulous. When I entered The Cupcake Station, I was greeted with two options. The chocolate cupcake with vegan buttercream frosting or the chocolate cupcake with vegan mocha frosting. Who was I to choose? I tried both. Now, I am usually not a fan of chocolate, because it can go really wrong, really fast. Chocolate done right deserves the utmost position in the flavor hierarchy. But chocolate done fast, cheap, and wrong does not even deserve a place on the table. The Cupcake Station's Chocolate Vegan Cupcake, my friends, is chocolate done right. Moist, rich, savory. For those of you who do not enjoy a powerful flavor punch, keep a glass of milk nearby.\n\nThe Buttercream frosting tasted very vanilla, and I thought I saw vanilla bean seeds throughout. It complimented the chocolate at all the right moments, like the perfect gentlemen on a perfect first date. Love at first . . . taste. I will be back for more.\n\nThe Mocha frosting was not my favorite. I will not be purchasing it again. It packed a powerful coffee taste and aroma with a pinch of caramel, which would be great if I liked that type of thing. I am the type of girl who likes a little coffee with my cream. It over powered me. Not only was it too strong for my taste, but it also had a scorched overtone. It was like burnt toast when you scrap off the black, but you can still taste it.\n\nAddendum: I attempted the mocha frosting again and it was actually tasty the second time around. Before I said that it had a scorched overtone. I believe firmly that something was scorched in the batch. This tasting everything was fresh, flavorful, but not overwhelming. I would actually buy it again! Rating for the mocha frosting up from a 1 to a 3. The only reason I tried it again with a 1 rating is because the vegan selection in the store for individual retail is limited.\n\nOverall, I love The Cupcake Station. There is no doubt that I will be returning and I can not wait to try more of their vegan flavors.\n\nI have to say, I could live at The Cupcake Station. Boosting great customer service, It is like a friend's house that is always filled with the aroma of baked goods. Where there are always cookies in the jar, a cake on the stand, and a pie in the oven. That is why it saddens me to say that I did not like the Red Velvet cupcake. I was expecting so much, and it left much to be desired.\n\nThe first bite, I tasted nothing but the vanilla buttercream frosting. Which taste great, but as cute as frosting is, I am not a fan of it. I started to get scared, because if the flavor of the cupcake could not shine through a little frosting, that said something. On the second bite, without frosting, I could taste a little bit of cocoa. Then, I was distracted by the texture of the cupcake. Moist, but a little too moist, mushy if you will. It had no structure, no \"chew\". On the third bite, I tasted nothing at all. : (","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:36:11Z","yelp_user_id":"QHU_q2MyD_Sg3LhMZol-Eg"},{"business_id":"_4CuwHPcNkGgqVp8fbFNdQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:23:52Z","date":"2012-02-26","review_id":"9fzROp0AVwQLVuSCVqrNGw","stars":5,"text":"These cupcakes are the absolute best in Ann Arbor!

Despite writing a negative review previously I was really pleased to see the management taking such an active role in their service. Way to go!\n\nWhen we went in it was later in the day, and most of the cupcakes were sold out, but the girl working there offered that she could make any cupcakes \"on request\" with the few that had just finished baking. She could have just told us that they were sold out for the day, and I really appreciated that they were so accommodating.\n\nJust for good measure I tried the Cream Francaise again, and found that the cupcakes are best enjoyed when you balance cake and frosting in the same bite. By itself, the Cream Francaise tastes pretty much like whipped butter, but if you balance it with a bite of cake its has a very nice, bread-and-butter sort of feel to it.\n\nWith that said, most of the frosting that I tried after stealing a bite of my friend's choices was *way* too rich or sweet for my liking, but that's just a matter of personal taste. Some people really enjoy an indulgent cupcake. And the cake base itself (I had chocolate) was fluffy and sweet and tasted very fresh.\n\nBecause of personal cake-preferences, I can't say that I would choose The Cupcake Station for my own cupcake experience, but I really appreciate how devoted the company is to creating a good customer experience, and I imagine that I'll pop in again on occasion.\n\n*Note; I still think that 2.75 is too expensive for a cupcake that's just frosting and cake, but I can imagine that would be a fair price for some of the more elaborate flavors. And they have deals on occasion for the cupcakes, so overall I can't say that its unfair.\n\nNormally I would give The Cupcake Station 3/5 on account that they're not my favorite cupcakes, but their customer service here bumps them up to a 4.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:07:12Z","yelp_user_id":"9R2B75C37gJo9cH0TjTTgw"},{"business_id":"_4CuwHPcNkGgqVp8fbFNdQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:27:36Z","date":"2012-01-14","review_id":"keAUjX0VyGd01Q2RE--upQ","stars":5,"text":"The Cupcake Station is one of the best around.

I assume the carrot cake batter is wetter than the chocolate batter, and it didn't have that awesome crispy outside the of the chocolate cupcakes. If they could get that crust on the carrot cake cupcake it would be perfect!\n\nThe ratio of frosting to cake is spot on.  Their cupcakes aren't simply platforms for frosting. You get the full flavor of the cake and a compliment of frosting to go with it. \n\nPersonally, I think the price tag per cupcake is perfectly adequate. One cupcake is plenty for dessert, and you'd pay just as much or more for a scoop of ice cream, piece of pie, etc.  We went on a Wednesday and it was \"buy 2 get 1 free\". Totally cost $5.50.

It came down to the last straw last week and I've decided never to return, even though it is the closest Showcase Cinema to where I live.\n\nFirst of all, they never open the screen curtain all the way. Ever. That is a major pet peeve of mine (you miss 1/4 of the film!) and they just don't seem to care enough about user experience to open that curtain.\n\nOne time I came to see a film and the aspect ratio was completely off. The characters' faces were squished - the reel was obviously not correctly aligned. No one seemed to be doing anything about it, and I wasn't about to watch the movie like that so I had to leave the film (with all my stuff) and go find a manager and tell him about it. I missed about 10 minutes of the movie, but at least the picture was fixed.\n\nThe very last time I went to this cinema, when my movie was over I stayed to see the credits, but about 2 minutes into them, the lights went up and about 7 theater staff came in to clean, but instead gathered around the exit (blocking it) and engaged in loud, screamy conversation and laughter until I couldn't deal with it anymore and had to squeeze my way through the group to leave.\n\nI find the staff at this cinema very unprofessional, the theaters untidy, and a complete and utter disregard for audience experience.

My favorite is the EuroTart, followed by Green Tea and then the Original. The topping selection is superb. There is a great assortment of fresh fruits, nuts, granola, mochi**!

Prices were definitely resonable; more expensive than Cali, but muchhhh cheaper than what they rip me off with in DC. \n\nTwist is open late--midnight on weeknights even! It seems like a great hangout place for students who are looking for somewhere a little different somewhat off campus that's not Starbucks or Panera Bread.

Of all the places I've reviewed on Yelp, Fruity Yogurt is by far my favorite!!  \n\nCOST:\nTwist is way too expensive, so I used to go less often for froyo but now that I've tried the lower prices at Fruity Yogurt, I get to satisfy my froyo cravings every week!! :) Ahhh I'm so happy haha.\n\nVARIETY:\nTwist only has eight types of fro-yo, and I only like two of them consistently, which was good enough for me at the time until I realized the possibilities haha.  There's something for everyone at Fruity Yogurt... it's like Twist but better, more types of fro-yo, more creative flavors, and more depth to the flavors too, and that's just talking about the frozen yogurt (they also serve the best bubble teas I've had here on the East Coast... it's so hard to do well). Just try it and you'll know... it's hard to explain.\n\nTASTE:\nThis is where Fruity Yogurt beats out Twist most of all, hands down.  Fruity Yogurt uses majority yogurt in its recipes, and it's milk-free in all but two flavors (Cookies n' Cream and Green Tea)... this is great and healthier than froyo that is majority milk-based.  Less preservatives and natural food coloring too! \n\nI used to be a big fan of Twist but now that I know what the flavors can be like in froyo, I'll never go back unless they change their recipes.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThis is where Twist has an advantage over Fruity Yogurt, because it's a much larger place with more seating.  On the other hand, at Twist I've sometimes had the displeasure of having to sit near really loud and annoying high schoolers (I guess it's a popular place for them?!).  I like the music at Fruity Yogurt more, and I've never had trouble finding a seat.  I like how Twist has board games and cool art on the walls, but it doesn't overcome the other cons for me.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nFruity Yogurt wins hand down.  Twist stole the former cashier at Fruity Yogurt by offering her a manager position.  I saw her working at Twist after being at Fruity Yogurt as the cashier weeks earlier; and that was the last time I went to Twist (I used to go just for the Eurotart flavor).  That's really lame, and one of the main reasons why I would refuse to go to Twist even if Fruity Yogurt somehow moved elsewhere.  \n\nTHE VERDICT?\nSave your money and go to Fruity Yogurt for more froyo variety, better taste, more for your money, and greater dessert and beverage options!  \n\nCheck out my other reviews of places in and around Pton! :)","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:16:12Z","yelp_user_id":"_UCg6jpZx6wlcRR3_Cob8w"},{"business_id":"_5_xjb9WdlGQ9BCnnLPHSg","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:07:12Z","date":"2009-06-03","review_id":"C1_5mhq2Gpa5_NSejjP07w","stars":4,"text":"This place is good.

But I think Twist merits an update, because I reviewed it when it first opened, and it has definitely made plenty of improvements since then.\n\nWithout ever meeting the owners of Twist, I can tell that they care. They have suggestion boxes and almost everything I nitpicked on back in December has been improved or completely revamped. Fruit offerings are wide and varied, even more so than pinkberry. This is not to say that some of it isn't frozen -- some strawberries i've tried have been on the hard side -- but they offer canned longan, pineapple, blackberries, peaches, blueberries, pomegranate etc... more types of fruit than I can stuff in my little cup. They also now offer 2 cup sizes so you don't feel like an absolute glutton when you bring your $7 cup to the register; I can happily fill up on the small size and have it total under $5.\n\nBut more so than anything else, Twist has improved on the previously mundane decor by having paintings by a local artist all over the store. The art is cheery, eclectic and quite interesting to look at. It doesn't have the commercial hip, trendy feel of Pinkberry, but it is warm, inviting, and they actually WANT you to sit and stay! Pinkberry's decor for sure is very chic, but those wire chairs aren't exactly intended for comfort. There have been times when I've felt that the chairs are designed so you don't linger too long, so the next customers can sit too. It's not that way at Twist at all. People linger and hang out because the leather chairs are comfortable and no one will ever bother you. While I said in my first review that Twist lacks a lot of the charm of Pinkberry and Red Mango, I can safely say that this isn't true anymore. I find that there's something slightly boring now about the decor and feel of the millions of froyo places that dot the city.

This forms their base yogurt to which they add flavours. The flavours are actually tasty and resemble their names and the yogurt tastes like something you couldn't get at the grocery store.

Being from Southern California, I have been in search for some good Mexican style food to satisfy my hungry tummy. When they posted their menu to their store front window, I would stop by weekly, teasing my taste buds with their delicious sounding menu. \n\nToday was their grand opening and believe me, I rushed there as soon as I could. Walking in, the place reminded me of a LA Pink Taco with a friendly taqueria set up. As I walked up to the bar to place my take out order, I was greeted by the bartender who kindly handed me over to a server. I ordered the two tacos, one pescado and one camaron. The server sweetly corrected me that I cannot mix tacos for one order, so I asked him which was better? He genuinely told me the shrimp was better, and with that, I trusted my first order with him. Also, because I am the kind of person who loves to go BIG when I eat, I added the pricey guacamole with tostadas. Just couldn't resist. \n\nAs I waited, I strolled through the menu once more and made mental notes of what I was going to order next. What can I say, food really excites me. They have Elote Asado, Mexican style street corn, which shoots me back to childhood memories of the friendly street vendors with grocery carts by my house. \n\nThe best part however was when the cute bartender came over to me and offered a homemade specialty organic margarita on the house to celebrate their grand opening. My eyes lit up!!! Free alcohol in the middle of day, OF COURSE!!! The margarita was rimmed with smokey paprica and a wedge of lime. However, the best part, the margarita itself. Not too overwhelming with the tequila flavor and believe me, I love the taste of tequila. Instead it was well balanced and exactly what a first margarita should taste like. \n\nWhen my order arrived from the kitchen, I rushed home to devour my meal. The camaron tacos hit a good spot. A good amount of shrimp, black beans, pickled red onion, a charred jalapeno and lime wedges within 2 warm corn tortillas, perfect. The guacamole did not disappoint as well. I ordered it high medium spicy and it was really delicious. I am a fan of lime and the guac had a nice little tang. The tostado chips were still warm and just complemented the guacamole. \n\nAll in all, I will be coming back and I hope that the service continues to stay up to par.

The space is fun - the best part is that they have arranged the outdoor seating area into like a porch.  It looked like a charming place to sit.  \nAnd now, on to the minuses.  And there are plenty.\nMargaritas.  The classic flavor tasted like it had been made with RealLime juice.  The stuff that comes out of a plastic lime.  It was sour and bitter, but not in a good way.  I ordered a rum and coke, and the server had to \"check\" with the bar to see if they could make it.  They did, but it was warm and flat.  \nSpecial requests to ask to leave something off of a dish -- say, if you have a food allergy, or you're just picky -- will not be accommodated.  When asked if it was possible to leave a sauce off of the steak, the server said \"Well, the kitchen is really picky about special requests because we're so busy.\"  One special request was accommodated; the other was ignored.\nThe tacos: the chorizo tacos, while delicious, were just plops of chorizo in tortillas (with the big pile of onions that I hadn't wanted).  Could have used some crunch or some green - or something.  My husband's tuna tacos were bland.\nI am sure the metal trays are intended to be cute or quaint.  They bummed my husband out.  Moving the tacos (which could be messy) from tray to tray was really a messy.\nThen, petty squabbles: Not enough room on the tables because the space is being taken up by napkin dispensers.

For this I have detracted a star...$8.50 for TWO LITTLE TACOS??!! I'm talking the little ones, with the maybe 4-inch diameter tortillas. Where I come from (an area of the country in which tacos abound) that's highway robbery, and laughable. These are tacos, which, by definition, are riffs on Mexican street food! A clever sprinkling of crispy fried onions does not a $4 price difference make. I have to say, $4.25 per taco feels insulting. For an appetizer (which you need because the tacos are little), tacos, a margarita, you're walking out of there having dropped $26 before tax and tip. That's for one person...yikes! This South Texan can't quite get her head around that.\n\nI would frequent the place more if the value was better.

Jeez, I'm getting old :P\n\nI'm usually wary of nice Mexican places - the cheap stuff usually tastes better - but it turned out I had no reason to be on guard with Cascabel.\n\nI came here with a friend and we started by splitting a couple appetizers. The blue crab and corn were more or less decent crab cakes, but the gorditas played a nice little trick on me. Served between two two-inch-wide thin fried masa cakes, the combination of pork belly, cucumber, cilantro and glaze reminded me more of a David Chang-esque pork belly bun than a traditional gordita. The pork, however, was kind of dry. Both were good, but neither was great.\n\nWe then split two orders of tacos: carne asada and carnitas. These were both very good. The meat was on the dryer side - the correct way to prepare a taco - and the toppings matched well, even if they were non-traditional. Their two hot sauces are worth applying - the roasted tomato for flavor and the diablo for scorching heat if you desire. \n\nMy one bone to pick with Cascabel, and the reason that I'm not giving it four stars, is that it's on the pricier side. $8.50 for a pair of tacos - you have to get two of the same in every order - is expensive no matter how you look at it. They're really good tacos, but there are many other places in the city that make better ones. At $7 it would still be more expensive than you could get elsewhere, but understandable. Not so at $8.50, especially since two tacos alone aren't going to fill you up. If it hadn't been for the appetizers I would have been apologizing to my stomach for the rest of the night.\n\nI'm glad to have Cascabel as an addition to the neighborhood. It has a good vibe and the food is pretty good. However, the main factors that would draw me back are if I'm feeling too lazy to go to the taco truck on 96th or Tehuitzingo in Hell's Kitchen, or if I were looking for a trendy Mexican restaurant, like a date place, close by. I'll probably drop in again to try the large plates.

They are totally refreshing as is writing about a vegetable normally ignored.  The guacamole could have a little more bite (next time upgrade from medium to hot, I guess) and could have had more acid.  I wanted to like their margaritias more but they were made a little too limey, maybe that is where the guacamole acid went? Why can't we mix and match tacos?

If I was judging on food alone, they would get 3 stars. The value is just so poor that I'm left giving 2 stars.\n\nCascabel is trying to upscale their \"street-style\" tacos with ingredients like tuna belly instead of white fish, hearts of palm instead of I'm not sure what, veal tongue instead of lengua, Amish chicken instead of the poor non Amish chicken. I'm all for it so far. I got excited to try the food when I read the menu. So you only get 2 tiny tacos for $8.50? That's OK - they have tuna belly in them.\n\nI split the tuna belly tacos and carnitas tacos, as well as guacamole con tostada, with a friend. The pieces or tuna belly were dipped in so much batter I literally could not see or taste any fish inside. They were not crispy or freshly out of the frier, but room temp and slightly soggy. That was a big disappointment. The tortillas were fine but the rest of the fillings were unremarkable. The taco badly needed some crunchy texture (usually from crunchy cabbage and crispy fried fish).\n\nCarnitas tacos were an improvement - the carnitas were nicely cooked and slightly crispy on the edges, although too salty. This was the most traditional sounding taco on the menu, with pickled onions and chili de arbol. You can get this exact taco in Arizona for $2.\n\nGuacamole was fine but a bit too acidic for my taste (too much lime). It was fresh, though, and I liked that we could order it spicy. The whole freshly fried tortillas looked nice but were kind of awkward to eat. There is something more appealing about a friendly little chip you can pop in your mouth.\n\nOthers have complained that the drinks were watery, but ours were not and I could definitely taste the tequila in my grapefruit juice and tequila. The accompanying hot salsa was good, but I didn't try the one marked \"marinara.\" Really? Food is served on stainless trays like at Brooklyn BBQ, where it makes more sense because they are serving large juicy chunks of meat to share on picnic tables. \n\nOur waiter was a really nice guy and a very skilled waiter and sported an excellent turquoise jacket. Total cost was $47 with tip for 2 tacos each, 1 drink each, and a few bites of shared guacamole. I left still hungry. I could easily have eaten 4 tiny tacos myself but didn't want to spend $75 on tacos for 2.\n\nAll in all, Cascabel is just trying too hard and it shows. They need to learn the basics before they can riff off of classics...and rip off the masses.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:45:34Z","yelp_user_id":"za-EKRvCiGutL6LPlJkvsw"},{"business_id":"_5BoZ_C5zEl5M_MxT1W39w","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:09:24Z","date":"2011-09-18","review_id":"HtnpYWCKWD34WW6CDWBU1Q","stars":1,"text":"This place is garbage.\n\nIt certainly looks the part of hip taqueria, but the execution is dismal at best.

And there are aspects of this restaurant that I do like. For starters, the staff here is very friendly and the food does come out quick. It's a hip place that pulls of this cool look while seeming very low maintenance. I like that their window doors (or are they just called glass doors?) can open up on a beautiful, warm, sunny day. And their bathroom was immaculate. Small, with a very tiny sink, but very very clean. I definitely appreciated that.\n\nThe only thing I did not love and is sadly, a very big thing, was the food. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch the first time and ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and Carnitas Tacos. We were really excited to try this place out and we had lucked out as it was a beautiful day so we sat on the inside by the window doors to enjoy the sunshine and warmth. We didn't love the fish taco but the carnitas were tasty. But the overall atmosphere with the sun and all left us with a more positive than negative opinion of the place.\n\nFast forward to my boyfriend's birthday. We had eaten a late lunch earlier in the day so we didn't feel hungry again until around 11pm. But by then a majority of the restaurants in this area are closed. Doing a quick yelp search for restaurants currently open, Cascabel Taqueria popped up. We decided to give this place another try as we weren't 100% sure whether we liked it.\n\nAgain, nice service, food came out quick, and very nice facilities. But the food was definitely not to our liking. We ordered the Pescado Tacos and the Puerco en Adobo. Again, didn't love the fish taco. (We had kind of forgotten we didn't love it the first time but we both love fish tacos, so any time we see it on the menu, we have to order it!) There was a very fishy aftertaste that even the lime could not hide. We were piqued by the hearts of palm and thought that was such an interesting item to add, but in the end it was kind of blah and left us underwhelmed. The Puerco en Adobo was sooo salty. My boyfriend didn't think it was too salty but did think the flavor was a bit off. I generally love salt but this was just too much. I ended up adding a ton of hot sauce to both items to hide the taste of the food.\n\nTo drink, we ordered a Watermelon Agua Fresca and a Fruit Punch Agua Fresca. My boyfriend didn't love his Watermelon Agua Fresca.. he thought the flavor was too subtle. The Fruit Punch Agua Fresca is tasty though.\n\nOverall, we do have a pleasant experience as far as the atmosphere is concerned. But we just can't bring ourselves to do that to our taste buds again. I am willing to give this place one more chance to try their brunch. But I'll definitely pass on this place for lunch and dinner.

They each had two soft flour shells and were overfilled with everything. The chipotle chicken was great, not real spicy but definitely flavorful. \n\nWhen I was done eating (sitting at the bar) the bartender was nowhere to be found.

It is always PACKED. So last night we decided, let's try it out. \n\nWorst. Idea. Ever. \n\nThe margaritas, while tasty, were certainly not worth $10 (hello, this is UWS, not the West Village). I can go purchase pomergranite hibiscus fruit juice and some tequila, too. . . Plus, draft beers were $7 (a high price for the neighborhood).\n\nThe food came out fast; however, they put all of the tacos on one plate, which was a messy feat in itself to get the correct food in front of you.\n\nI ordered the Camaron Tacos (described as roasted shrimp, fresh oregano, garlic, chili oil, and black beans) only to received 2 tiny tacos of stewed baby shrimp (presumably from a can) in a sauce that tasted like chorizo. Excuse me, but if I'm paying $8.50 for 2 (miniscule) tacos, I expect there to at least be 3 full sized roasted shrimp per taco. And while the chorizo-tasting sauce was yummy, it was clear that it was used to cover up any shrimp-from-a-can flavor. \n\nMy fiance ordered the Pescado Tacos, which were each about twice the size of one of my tacos. They were pretty tasty, but needed some spice (of course, there was no salsa to be found). \n\nThe service was okay. Our waitress was friendly, but they kept trying to clear my plate, when I was clearly still eating our breakfast radish side dish (which uses \"mexican herbs\", aka cilantro). We ordered dessert, flan and churros. While the churros were 3 for a $1, they were also tiny, and the equivalent of having one, medium sized churro. HOWEVER, the flan was the most absurd rip-off. $4 for what was 3 bites worth of flan. That's about $1.50 per bite. And it didn't come in with a caramel sauce, it was floating on a sea of plain simple syrup. \n\nIf you want AUTHENTIC mexican food (and more bang for your buck), I suggest Taqueria y Fonda around the corner. Otherwise, save yourself some money and make your maragaritas at home.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:41:52Z","yelp_user_id":"jJ8bJj2sevxXs2ZFoy9ctQ"},{"business_id":"_5BoZ_C5zEl5M_MxT1W39w","created_at":"2013-03-15T17:59:22Z","date":"2011-07-03","review_id":"uConhOdtEw9xBk6yJKg5hg","stars":4,"text":"glad they made their way to the uws.  definitely a great addition to the neighborhood.  had heard great things about them from the ues, but didnt want to make the shlep.\n\nguacamole  (hot)... wasnt so spicy - we added lime and used their yummy salsas to compliment\nshrimp, chicken and vegetable tacos - all good street food\nquinoa and frijoles - nice healthy addition but too much cheese, which made it salty\n\nbut hey - they have negra modelo on tap!

I think 3 1/2 stars would be spot on, actually.\n\nThe tacos are good, don't get me wrong, but they are all missing a little ooomph. \n\nI get excited when I read the descriptions but when they come out they're a bit of a let down. The flavors are all a bit even keeled. No one flavor pops or sings. However, the reason I keep going back is because the Diablo sauce sitting on the table. It adds the oomph the tacos need. It is nicely acidic, smoky, spicy and well balanced. I've tried it on all of their tacos (but the fish and vegetable) and it's great. Love it.\n\nThe same let down goes for the pork belly (Gorditas Con Puerco) and the beef rib (Costilla de Carne). Both sound amazing on the menu and both aren't bad but they don't taste as good as they sound. The pork belly sauce doesn't have enough of the smoky spicy Chipotle to balance the sweetness of the honey. I love that combination but it's just not properly balanced. Too sweet for my taste. \n\nThe beef rib (Costilla de Carne) sounds amazing, cumin and pasilla chile puree, lime creme and radish salad. Wow, sounds like an incredible combination. But the cumin and pasilla puree lacks power. I barely tasted cumin the first time I had it. The second time it was better but still a little weak. It's as though they are afraid to really let those flavors come out in fear of putting people off....? Same for the lime creme. It was more or less just creamy. It didn't have that acidic punch (balanced with cool creaminess) I was expecting.\n\nOk, now on to really good things. The Corn (Elote Asado), of course, and the radishes (Rabano) are superb as is the soup (Sopa de Tortilla). I also think their guacamole rivals that of Rosa Mexicano which is nearly perfect. And I like that the \"chips\" are actually a complete fried corn tortilla. Fun, and very nicely crispy.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice. Lively and casual but not crazy or too loud. Sitting outside with their tasty drinks and the tacos with that wonderfully smoky Diablo sauce, like I did last night, is really good. I'll keep going back and would recommend it to everyone, but I hope they read this and bring out some punch in the flavors for some of their items.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:57:56Z","yelp_user_id":"UOlqY-K-HNaOPT4hq_07Kw"},{"business_id":"_5BoZ_C5zEl5M_MxT1W39w","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:13:37Z","date":"2012-06-14","review_id":"WaWn-0bbh49P-QNZeNsp1g","stars":3,"text":"I came here because my grandmother requested tacos.

Usually...I would be at work or in class during their business hours.  \n\nThe \"hostess\" isn't friendly.  It looks like she wants to blow the place up actually.  But I wouldn't blame her. Being stuck inside a dingy place would do that to anyone.  To give you an idea, it's as if you were to go to someone's grandparent's house.  The tables have an ugly overlay, the rails are a dark green, and the chairs are a run down.  But...that's not why I chose to give this place two stars.\n\nI know most of us Yelpers don't really judge a place too much on decor (or at least rate them down for having an ugly lamp).  This place reminds me of a \"classier\" Denny's.  I hate Denny's - but I'll save that rant for later.  I was told this place has a good brunch, which is why I decided to go here in the first place.  But, to my own demise, I decided to eat a lunch meal.  \n\nMy best friend and I ordered two hamburgers: mushroom swiss and the blue cheese burger.  It's the standard type of burger you could find basically anywhere (around $8.95/each).  Here is my gripe.  The waiter (more friendly than the wicked witch in front) asked how we would like the burgers.  We both ordered medium rare.  Both burgers came back well done without a hint of....rareness.  Why ask if the cook is going to do his own damn thing anyway?  Oh, and the bun was a weird mixture of some cornmeal, wheat, and crap.  But...that was our fault for not stating wheat (he didn't ask).  The buns on both burgers were also drenched - I am hoping from the mushroom, lettuce, and tomatoes.  \n\nThe plus side to coming to Le Peep is they have a GREAT tomato basil soup.  \n\nMaybe I am being to hard on this place, but the quality of food was just so...poor.  I had higher expectations and should've advise Yelp before coming here.  I've scanned a few other reviews and it seems as though the food is rarely made to how to order.  \n\nLe Peep can keep the ugly decor, but give me good food.  Is that so much to ask?

I moved to the area in May and was due for my 6 month cleaning. When I came in, I waited about an hour to go back. First I had X-Rays done, which took a while, before the actual dentist saw me. She proceeded to tell me that my bottom teeth had shifted since I had braces and that I should get them straightened out. I told her I wear my retainers every night and she said they can still move during the day (which does make sense). She said I need to fix the bottom and top (which my top teeth are perfectly straight) with Invisalign which would cost me about $2,600 with my insurance. And this is only to fix a few teeth on my bottom row. Then she wanted me to have her put a fixed retainer in so my teeth wouldn't move anymore........ \n\nAfter all this she then tells me she doesn't have time to do my cleaning which was the whole point of me coming in, but she does an exam of my mouth and says that I have a cavity and I will come back later to get that filled as well as the cleaning. When I go out from to make that appointment, the lady at the front desk tells me that I owe $50 to secure my next appointment - $30 for the cleaning and $20 for the cavity. I thought this was strange because my previous dentist NEVER made me pay for those things, let alone PAY for them before even getting them done. Whatever, I paid the money and left. \n\nWhen I got home, I called my other dentist, and they confirmed that my insurance completely pays for all cleanings and cavities and there should be nothing for me to pay for. So I decided I no longer want to go here,  I go back to the dentist to cancel my appointment and get my money back. They told me I can keep the money there and use it towards my next appointment. Which was fishy because how do you know what I will need next time I come (even though I am never coming back)?! \n\nNext time I went back to my home town, I asked my dentist for a second opinion, and I never even had a cavity where the other doctor told me I did.

I feel bad to write such a review, but at the same time, I want to make sure that people who are searching for a dentist get real feedback. Dr. Khalili seems like she knows what she is doing, but i feel like she was trying to push products on me that I didn't really need like teeth whitening--and told me that I needed to have a lot of uneccessary work done on my teeth. maybe because she knew I was an SC student she figured I had money to burn.  She told me that I needed to get approximately $5,000 worth of dentist work done on my teeth! I went to go get a second opinion with another dentist, and they told me there were only two things I needed to get fixed (which would only cost 500 bucks)\n\nI would never suggest anyone to come here. I've given this place many chances, but it is poorly run and I found unprofessional.\n\nThe first time I went, I had set up an appointment just for a regular cleaning and check up. The assistant that came to get me opened the door with gloves on. When she asked me to sit down and began to get all the equipment--she didn't change her gloves. She began to reach into my mouth. I was disgusted! That door handle must have been touched by many patients....When I got home I rinsed my mouth with listerine  5times.\n\nThe second time I went, I set up an appointment to be the first patient in the morning. I arrived 5 min early, and ended up wating 40 min before anyone showed up at the office to open the door! I'm sorry, if someone has an appointment at 9 am in the morning, you better be there before the patient. Then when they finally opened up the door, I waited another 15 min before they saw me. I was pissed...\n\nThe third time (yes I know, i shouldn't have gone back, but I'm a big believer in giving second chances, I mean maybe something happended to make the dr late), I waited 3 hours....yes 3 hours just to see the dentist for 15 min to review my x-rays---This was even after I repeatedly asked the receptionist if I could just come back at another time.

For there is finally a spectacular Lindy venue in Berkeley, with a beautiful ballroom in a beautiful building, with excellent instructors and just a really great bunch of social dancers.\n\nI've gone to a handful of \"swing dance\" venues in the East Bay, and most of them tend to be attended by an older set, with more of an emphasis on arm's-length East Coast Swing. So I've really been craving a local venue that has all the style and energy that someplace like The 9:20 Special has in SF. The Dancers' Den really is that place. The instructors, Jean and Bromley, really know how to teach the moves in an easily understood way, and they make it really fun. The dance floor is great, the decor is beautiful, the dancers range from beginner to veteran, and the atmosphere is unbelievably friendly.\n\nThe venue is new, and the goal is to make this a weekly event until forever comes along. But since they're just starting out, there will be a handful of weeks early on where the Dancers' Den will be closed due to previously-scheduled events at the venue. But, as time goes on and we continue to support the Den with our dollars and our feet, they'll surely become a weekly staple for the local Lindy Hop community.

I simply think that this is a great restaurant for dinner.  The atmosphere is conservatively presented.  It has a dark warm appearance.  There is a variety of music that is always being presented in the background. If you do not wish to dine in the dining area, you may dine in a bar area, where there are multiple TV monitors located about. During the winter months there is a fireplace with a warm roaring fire to dine near.  During the summer, a rather large patio area is available for outside dining.\n\nWhat about the food?  Where do I begin?  The Prime Rib is excellent. Also the steaks are very good.  Even their chicken and salmon is very tasty, especially for a steakhouse. If you like salads, I recommend the Caesar. And finally wonderful well presented desserts are available that include such items as Cr\u00e8me Brulee and a Mini Cherry Cheese Cake.

My husband ordered the 8 oz steak frites, and I the chopped salad.  We waited patiently for our food, amongst the rather mundane conversations of Harvard med students referring to themselves as Dr this and Dr that, in the 3rd person.  Our food finally arrived, my salad was huge and my side of veggies were decent but not sure they were worth the $6 price tag. The disappointment was my husband's steak. Now I am a seasoned Weight Watcher, so I am pretty good at recognizing food weights/amounts. There was NO way my husband's steak was 8 oz, more like 3 oz. It was tiny. The fries were good, but a very small portion. I saw the man sitting next to me ordered a burger with fries, and his plate was over flowing with fries. He must have gotten my poor husband's portion. For $21 he expected more. They also have raised their prices and have neglected to change them on their website. Boo. We will probably be back to have drinks at the bar, but will not be running back for dinner.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:33:37Z","yelp_user_id":"-3k65IY08ckDcOGQmf8BDg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:41:53Z","date":"2010-10-10","review_id":"_5QwUJ0FQkbTAZZCzYw7dA","stars":4,"text":"Found myself here twice this week, and both times were pretty pleasant.\n\nThe first time was a Friday after drinks.

After an undetermined number of CBC pale ales, I can't promise my recollection is on point.\n\nFirst off, I should say that our server was very tolerant.  Seeing as we were decked out in running gear (my boyfriend wore a flattering two-piece camouflaged underarmor body suit) and on the better side of tipsy, I thought we might be relegated to a remote corner of the basement.  Luckily we were seated upstairs quickly and given brunch menus as if we were normal human beings.\n\nI ordered the \"anti eggs benedict\"  - think normal eggs benedict but with garlicky sauteed spinach and sausage.  The poached eggs are coated in panko bread crumbs and fried.  That is the \"anti\" part I believe.  Unfortunately my server forgot to note this and I got anti-anti-eggs benedict.  Can't complain though, she comped me my beer (Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project) and the fried eggs might have been overly rich.  I enjoyed my meal; I might ask to reduce the salt if possible next time.  This seems to be a trend here.\n\nAnyway, the group as a whole enjoyed their food and (unnecessary) drinks to top off a rainy race morning.

Have been to this restaurant for lunch a few times and for drinks and apps a few times. It's a nice space, good menu and the food is usually very nicely prepared. But something typically goes wrong during my meals there -- either with the food, the service, but it's unfailing.\n\nToday, I went in for a 2-course restaurant week lunch menu. The menu offered two options for each course. Starter (oysters, corn cakes -- both excellent), entree (parpadelle, chicken confit), and dessert (which we skipped). But they didn't have the parpadelle! So the only entree choice was fried chicken. Which was tasty, but not my idea of lunch (three large pieces of thickly fried chicken with a heavy biscuit and slaw). The biscuit was still cold in the middle too and had been microwaved in haste. \n\nThey hadn't run out of the parpadelle, but rather, it wasn't ready yet. This was at 1:15pm, not sure when it was eventually ready. The couple that came in a few minutes later and sat next to us got the same answer. It was really poor. \n\nComplains from previous visits include underdone fish (still slimy, unintentionally so), a 20+ minute wait after being seated before a drink order was taken, and generally slow or uncommunicative service. They seem to run out of things or not have a dish on the menu fairly frequently (twice before this visit). \n\nAll of which is a real shame, because when they get it right, this place can be delicious, but I have come to associate it with disappointment.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:41:43Z","yelp_user_id":"OBBRoVZZIEbHqxVBy-J0cA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:40:13Z","date":"2010-05-24","review_id":"_n0d77h4hfYcDALV_REE7Q","stars":3,"text":"Meh - Not overly impressed with this place.  \n\nI don't drink beer or wine, so that leaves me with cocktails if I am planning on getting a drink.

Half their alcohol I had never heard of before, so I just grabbed a vodka and coke, usint the house raspberry-infused vodka.  It was nice, nothing to write home about, but hey this is Yelp, not home.\n\nOnly a handful of items on the menu called out to me at all, which I never perceive to be a good sign, but it was starting to get late and it was either eat something now, or eat everything later. Cha Cha recommended eating the little now so I don't pay for it later.  So I got the crab cakes, which i admit were pretty good.\n\nDespite their only being about 15 of us seated at the bar, it seemed hard to get the bartenders attention when we needed it\n\nSo overall, not a place I would suggest off hand, but not a place I would refuse either.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:05:12Z","yelp_user_id":"HYMHTMJ_06k7BPggKgacLA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:47:18Z","date":"2011-06-11","review_id":"_qkZveBKdQMh0eN9hhUHPg","stars":4,"text":"HOLY.CRABCAKE.SANDWICH. \n\nCame here for brunch with a couple of friends and had an AWESOME time.

Whoops.  It was a half-hour wait for the three of us.  Luckily, there were three spots at the downstairs bar, so we sat down to enjoy a drink while we waited.  I had the Jacobin Club, a cocktail with St. Germain and grapefruit juice (and some fancy-sounding shit I don't remember).  Good, but perhaps a little too sweet.  My boyfriend was excited that they sold Goose Island Matilda (we haven't seen it much around the Boston area, since it's a Chicago beer).  Overall, we were impressed with their liquor selection.\n\nAfter some seating confusion with the hostesses (are you seating us upstairs or downstairs??  JUST TELL US), we finally got a table in a cozy corner downstairs.  I was adamant that we start with the Creamy Spinach Gratin appetizer, which I fell in love with at the Elite event.  Yep, still amazing.  I never realized that spinach and bleu cheese were soulmates.  Now I know.  I probably could have eaten a whole meal of just the spinach, but I grudgingly allowed my companions to share.\n\nFor the meal itself, I was hoping we could order a bunch of small plates, but no one else wanted to do that, so I ordered two for myself: the Crispy Soft Poached Chip-In Farm Egg and the Chicken Liver Crostini.  The poached egg was, for lack of a better word, AMAZEBALLS.  The second I punctured it with my fork and the delightfully runny yolk oozed out, I knew I was in for a treat.  (Sorry to all you runny yolk haters - I probably just grossed you out big time.)  The crispy egg sat atop a piece of toasted brioche, with pancetta and pecorino aioli.  All the flavors and textures worked perfectly together; this dish was basically flawless.  The Chicken Liver Crostini was very good as well, but I think it came with too much prune and honey jam - the sweetness was in danger of overpowering the pate.  I had to scrape some off.\n\nWe decided go elsewhere for dessert, but I was definitely tempted by a few things on the menu.  I've since moved out of state, but I have a feeling I'll be back to Russell House Tavern.

She said that the tables were only for those who wished to eat food, and that if we decided to sit at a table, we would be encouraged to have something to eat as only patrons eating were allowed to sit at the tables. There was NO ONE in the restaurant. We had every intention of eating there, but this woman's attitude was just too much.

Because you are there. A lot. This undoubtedly makes Russell House Tavern my local. And for that, I am thankful. \n\nI've stumbled in, stumbled out, tried nearly everything on the menu, sipped wine from the tap, beer from the bottle, knocked back more Fernet than I should admit, met up with friends, ran into some more, sat at the upstairs bar with the windows open, sat downstairs in the lounge and even brunched on the patio. It's just one of those places where you can do all of those things and they are all so well done.\n\nPoints that separate Russell House from the pack? The editing process of their bar, for starters. There's hardly anything more exciting than the opportunity to be introduced to a new beer/wine/spirit of which I was previously unfamiliar. Nope, you just won't find the same old selection here. And if that's what you're looking for, then there's plenty of other bars to hit up in Boston. If you're curious, ask about their wine on tap, their extensive craft beer selection or their scotch list.\n\nFor lunch, dinner, brunch or late-night snacks, the Russell House menu features dishes in a wide range of proteins, flavors and price points. You'll find pizzas are big enough to share, while small plates are perfectly sized to enjoy 2-3 per person. Traditional entrees range from $10 - $28, and you'd be a fool not to find something to love: lamb shank, an Ozark pork trio (belly, shoulder and loin) two steaks and a really bad-ass burger served on an English muffin. The fries, with their crispy, salty perfection of texture, make it hard for me to eat them any where else. Among my favorites: the egg, the charcuterie and the pork trio.\n\nWhether at the bar or a table, I've found the service to be pretty on point, with the food generally arriving in the right amount of time, the staff smiling and helpful, and water glasses, shot glasses, beer glasses and cocktails are always full. And despite the busy summer season, getting a seat here is a relatively smooth and swift process. The only night I absolutely couldn't get a table was during Harvard graduation. Fair enough.\n\nA melding of creative, well-priced food, a welcoming and warm atmosphere (the decor improvements from the previous inhabitant are tremendous), finely crafted cocktails and a beer and wine list that will both educate and satisfy you, Russell House is the piece that's been missing from Harvard Square; a bar/lounge/restaurant that lacks pretension, caters to the curious with being too obscure and never fails to make for me a difficult time of narrowing down just what exactly I am going to eat and drink each time I go.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:45:19Z","yelp_user_id":"hBicl52tMVsTecdZSVL-lQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:40:01Z","date":"2011-11-06","review_id":"-YhvdlQwMktmMwFAyUZv5w","stars":5,"text":"After a fun-filled night of karoke near BU, we wanted to cruise back over to Harvard for a night cap.

For entrees, people had the grassfed burger which they seemed to enjoy, the crabcakes which had a different consistency from crabcakes I've had anywhere else, but were good, the chicken sandwich, which I thought was delicious.  So, all in all, it was a very interesting and delicious meal.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone looking to try new types of food, or foodies, but if you wander in thinking it is a traditional tavern with the traditional fare, you are out of luck.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:27:43Z","yelp_user_id":"CMLfpkAiOuEQn9qyg81SZg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:14:26Z","date":"2010-08-20","review_id":"0Em78JicWhLUXDecRsosyQ","stars":3,"text":"What's all the fuss with Russell House? I came in for a solo lunch and had a pleasant enough experience. I mean, it's a gastro pub in Harvard Square, a needed thing by all means, but not sure if it's worth writing to Mom and Dad about. Maybe I'm wrong. I dunno. A few things that caught my attention as I sat at the upstairs bar for lunch on a Thursday afternoon on a warm August day:\n\n-There is a downstairs bar? Huh. I would have sat in these shady depths had I known that to be an option. The sun hurts me. Hurts I say. \n\n-Crab cakes are my enemy. They look so good and I want them, but they hurt me deeply. Like literally every time I have them, I suffer. So why do I order them? Russell House is no exception. That's my fault for ordering, but their fault for making them look so good on my neighbors plate. Damn you both. \n\n-Excellent little beer list. Loved the Bengali Tiger IPA on tap. A perfect cold beer for a warm day. Would have loved to have a few more but life was calling and I for once was listening. \n\n-Bar staff was nice enough. Prompt. Seemed to be mixing up some interesting drinks. Made with the water. Cleared the mess. Charged the credit card. Did not harass. \n\n-Interior is modern. Clean. A little too clean maybe. I like a few stuffed deer heads on the walls. \n\n-View of pedestrian traffic in Harvard Square is both fun and daunting. How many faux goth Harvard freshmen can I look at while smashing a mediocre crab cake down my gullet?\n\nAll in all. Not bad at all.

I think it says a lot about the hospitality of the staff that just because a manager knew my friend's face, our party of four was greeted with a jump to the front of the waitlist on a busy night--to a nice table, nonetheless--and drinks on the house. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout the night, checking on us frequently. Also, the ambiance is really perfect--chatty but with a lot of quiet corners, and there's a sort of understated classiness about the place that's really nice.\n\nI might be bringing people back here in future for this alone, but everything about the food and drink was similarly wonderful. Russell House serves up a really nice mix of comforting and innovative gastropub-type fare, and everything was luscious. I especially liked the Crispy Pig's Head Cake, which is everything good about pork, deep-fried and served with a poached egg and a mapley reduction of some sort. It was sweet and unctuous and decadent.\n\nThe raw bar is a huge plus. If you're looking for a place in Cambridge to stop for a round of oysters, this is your ticket: Island Creek seems to always be a good bet 'round these parts, and Russell stocks them. I had two friends with me who had never had oysters before, and I knew this would be a good place to initiate them--they came away oyster-lovers. Totally fresh, briny, and perfect.\n\nGotta give a nod to the extensive drinks lists, as well. I haven't tried out their cocktails yet, but the house list is the sort of mixology-type experimentation I've come to enjoy--lots of St. Germaine and rye. When I was uncertain about which beer to order (they have a nice assortment of craft brews, many local), the waitstaff was amazingly attentive and knowledgeable in helping me pick, asking about my preferences before making recommendations. So fun!\n\nSeriously good stuff.

We decided to to some sharing of small plates and had the soft shell crab pizza (of which I could have simply ate the soft shell crab off the top and been happy), the deep fried egg (an epicure's delight) and what I thought was the highlight: the smoked pork shoulder terrine with mustard seed and honey gelee. Yeah it really is as good as it sounds and probably better. Words do not do the terrine justice as it brought me to provincial France, a British public house and to my hometown Jawjah in a single bite. \n\nReeling but unfazed, we split the obligatory roast chicken. It was perfectly cooked and the carrots were wonderfully shaped and roasted. I guarantee that there was no butter in the mashed potatoes. None (HA!). At some point during the meal I had a Wachusett Belgian that I was not to fond of as the server, though cheery, was not as knowledgeable about beer as should could have been working at a place to this caliber. I wanted something with bright hops, aromatics and a touch of bitterness and I got a syrupy, viscousy, amber Belgian. \n\nDesert was an afterthought after my food baby started knocking at my ribcage but they had carrot cake bread pudding. That's right, beloved carrot cake with beloved bread pudding coupled together like the Olson twins (although of course, they would not partake).

Plates are well-presented and the kitchen does a fantastic job of layering flavors and textures. My wife and I were there twice yesterday: once to check the place out and see if we wanted to return for dinner with our son. We had a friendly knowledgeable bartender. The first thing he did after greeting us was to pour a couple of glasses of water. We washed down aforementioned deviled eggs with pints of Harpoon Belgian Ale and a dark German wheat beer. Both were excellent. We liked the menu and reserved a table for dinner in the bar. \n\nFast forward and we're back with our 10-year-old after his hockey game ended. Dinner was Pt. Judith \"Trace & Trust\" Bluefish w/ Creamed Verrill Farms Corn, Roasted Pink Eggplant, Radish Salad ($23); Ozark Heritage Pork Trio: Loin, Belly, Shoulder with Anson Mills Grits and Sauce Vinegar ($23); and Steak Frites at $24. All were delicious. The bluefish portion could have been a little more generous. \n\nService is where Russell Tavern really needs to improve. It took 10 minutes for our server to arrive, then another 15 to get bread and 45 minutes to get our entrees after ordering.

Instead, I had to flag her down and ask when the meals would arrive. Also, the tables in the bar are much too close; uncomfortably so.

The food here is quite good, though not of the Craigie on Main sort. I'd give it a B to B+ grade for price-to-quality ratio -- 3.2 stars.\n\nAtmosphere is nice here -- not too loud, not too quiet. And the tables are spaced far enough apart for comfort. But I was never a big fan of eating in windowless basements, and that's what RHT is: a windowless basement.\n\nRHT serves bread and olive oil to start. The bread isn't very good -- too dry, tough, and relatively flavorless. It's sort of peasant bread but taken to the extreme. Ask your server for salt & pepper to flavor the olive oil a bit (there won't be any salt and pepper on your table).\n\nTonight I started by splitting the House Charcuterie Board app with my dining companion. She loved the chicken liver pate, which I didn't like at all. But I never liked chicken liver very much, so that's no fault of RHT's. My favorite charcuterie item was the Smoked Berkshire Pork Rillette (which my DC hated). So all in all, it worked out well -- she ate all the chicken liver pate, I ate all the rillette, and we split the other (very very tiny) items on the charcuterie board. The prune & honey jam that comes with the charcuterie board is worth its weight in gold. Oddly, there's no mustard, though. It was a good app, but I'd bet you can do better here -- I would've rather gotten the \"3 sides for $15\" deal (ALL their sides looked appealing -- the brussel sprouts, the grits, the potato & cheddar gratin).  I also got a Caesar salad, which was tasty enough, though it was not especially unique or different in presentation or taste (anchovy-flavored croutons were an attempt at that, I guess). I was in a burger mood, so I just got their R. House Grass Fed Burger. I ordered it medium rare and they nailed it -- perfectly cooked. The meat was flavorful. Although it was cute that they served it on an English muffin, the English muffin was dry and not very tasty. It didn't add value; I would've rather had a good bun or roll. It also came with fairly nondescript bacon and cheese (i.e., good enough, but nothing uniquely flavorful or mindblowing). It's definitely not anywhere near what you'd get at Craigie on Main, but it's only $12. And at $12, a bacon cheeseburger with fries at a mostly high-end Harvard Square restaurant ain't bad. The fries were medium thickness and tasty but again, not mind-blowing. Oh -- the mayo that comes w/the burger plate was really good and tasted homemade. That mayo was another high point.  We were in a rush, so we skipped dessert there. I should mention that my DC had the market fish (striped bass, perhaps?) and really liked it.\n\nService was wonderful. Our server was attentive without hovering. The only screw-up -- and it was pretty major -- was that they brought the entrees WAY too early. We were about 3/4 done w/the charcuterie plate when they came out with the entrees. So my burger and fries sat on the other end of the table getting cold for 10 minutes. I dunno why they did that.\n\nWould I go back to RHT? Yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Although the food is different from what you'd get at say Henrietta's Table, I'd rate it similarly as far as food quality goes (though Henrietta's has much nicer ambiance due to copious natural light) -- i.e., very good quality, okay prices for Harvard Square, but you won't rave about the food to your friends the next day.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:48:02Z","yelp_user_id":"WvtxnIGcmJQ8Kn1z8MG00Q"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:24:12Z","date":"2011-03-22","review_id":"2tu-ornvrBQJZGb3KLAThg","stars":4,"text":"Great burger, great fries.

I especially love the photographs and comfy plush seating.\n\nThe waitstaff (there are tons of them) must have a position for everything - waitress, bus boy, drink-deliverer. It was \"uppity\" and it was a little chaotic as a patron. A moment or two after the bread was delivered, so were our oysters. The person delivering the oysters moved the bread plate away while one person in my party was trying to dunk their bread.

The mood from the ambiance wants you to have a relaxing calm experience and I hope they calm down as the staff gets more comfortable with the restaurant.\n\nThe food and drinks were pretty great. I got two Moscow Mules and they were delicious and strong. It's nice getting a strong drink while you're dining out. To start we had some oysters and the Painted Hills Steak Tartare which were really good. For entrees I ordered the R.House Burger (was debating getting the Hearth Baked Pasta). It was pretty good but kind of sloppy. We also ordered three sides - creamy spinach, creamy grits (are you seeing a trend here?), and the roasted vegetables. All were really good, but clearly we ordered too much food for three people and ended up taking most of the sides home.\n\nWe were with someone who always insists on ordering dessert, otherwise I wouldn't have really bothered. Their dessert menu is sort of limited. We ended up getting the yogurt cake with honey, ice cream, and basil sauce.

Furthermore, if they source their veggies from Verrill Farm, they clearly have excellent produce -- why not add a single entree to showcase that produce?  Every other meat-heavy restaurant in the area (Craigie on Main comes to mind) has a separate section of vegetarian food, or dishes that could be made vegetarian via substitutions.  To me, this just speaks to the limitations or lack of imagination on the part of the chef.

Went there for a birthday party last night and ran into perhaps the worst service in the restaurant business.  Some examples:\n1. We ordered a bottle of wine for a few people - the waitress had me taste the wine, went away to pour it for others, and completely forgot to fill my glass while finishing the bottle.  She did not apologize at all but rather had the gall to suggest I order another bottle.\n2.  I declined on ordering another bottle and decided to go for a beer instead. Oops - the beer I order off the 4 day old menu is not available. Why have it on your menu if u dint have it?\n3.  Giving up on beer, I decided to order a Tom Collins. The waitress asks me what kind of vodka I want in my drink. One small problem - Tom Collins is not made with vodka at all. Why ask me something u have no idea about - just tell the bartender what I want.\n4.  Before my drink saga ended, I had been served somebody else's drink and had a different waitress try to take my order. The Tom Collins was actually quite excellent - pity it was ruined by the service.\n5.  The food was also brought out haphazardly - see some of the other reviews on this. Appetizers came out as main courses, the waitress could not remember who had ordered what and would randomly place the dishes in front of us. We had to rearrange on our own.\n6. The worst came at the end when we wanted to split on 6 cards - not a very unreasonable request I think for a bill that was around 50 dollars per person. The waitress flat out stated that she could not split on more than 5 cards. Why??? No idea.  Even when we put it on 5 cards and the rest in cash, she had a tough time charging the cards.  Before our nightmare ended, she had charged 2 of the cards for wrong amounts and wasted more than 20 mins.\n\nEven despite all our troubles, the manager did not apologize or offer to make it better. My advice is to wait a couple of months before they sort out their service or go to the bar.

The menu looked awesome, and we'd had good dinners there in the past. We were incredibly disappointed by what we were served there. \n\nMy boyfriend had the American Egg Plate. He ordered it with the \"House Ginger Sage Breakfast Sausage\". It came with the bacon by mistake, so he asked for the sausage. They brought it. The sausage was burned and not worth eating. Maybe they cooked it too fast once they realized the mistake. The bacon was awful (I know, right? how do you ruin BACON, for pete's sake? the texture was horrible, and it had practically no flavor). The eggs were runny, and the toast came completely dry with nothing to put on it. It was pathetic, and he sent it back having eaten only a few bites.

It made no sense to us that the Russell House can't manage eggs, bacon, sausage, toast... ???\n\nI had the Anti-Benedict--eggs benedict with the egg poached and then fried. It was okay, but--the hollandaise sauce was just nasty. Thin, runny, tasteless...I have had so many much better hollandaise sauces, I just couldn't believe Russell House can't manage a hollandaise. The lame sauce pretty much ruined that meal for me, because that's the best part of eggs benedict. I ate it anyway, but would not order it (or their regular Benedict) again. The best eggs benedict I've had lately was at Uncommon Grounds in Watertown. They're just a little diner. Russell House thinks pretty smart of itself, but in this case, they were badly beaten by a little diner in Watertown. \n\nWe will never go back to Russell House for brunch.

The bartender assured me they were still open and to sit anywhere. We parked ourselves at one of the tall center tables and it pretty much all went downhill from there. The bartender was so sarcastic and rude it was ridiculous - first telling us to order from our server, who then told us (within earshot of the bartender) to order from the bartender, who then looked at me with an obnoxious smirk, and replied \"he's new,\" referring to the server. \n\nIt took 20 minutes to get in an order and have it delivered, despite the fact that I could reach the bar from where I was sitting, the room is so small, and the bartender knew that we had been waiting.

Generally, service in the bar is better than in the dining room, and service sitting at the bar is by far the best.\n- Brunch food is not so good. When they opened it was fantastic, but they changed their menu and now brunch is overpriced and nothing to write home about.\n- The crowd at the bar can be pretty loud and irritating on weekend nights--it's not as bad as Grafton St. (owned by the same group) but I wouldn't go there on a weekend.\n\nOverall, I go to Russell House regularly--it's one of my neighborhood restaurants--but if you want a great gastropub experience, there are better ones in Cambridge.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:54:21Z","yelp_user_id":"pjDFRGl8Gkm7wk4j3MPzlw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:36:15Z","date":"2012-05-30","review_id":"4yKrDuH9lUYMsw9fGO_qNA","stars":4,"text":"Went here for lunch while wandering around Cambridge and really enjoyed it!

So, kudos to you, Russell House. This place is typically hopping with, whom I would assume to be, Harvard kids and grads - some spending, others beginning, their evening either at the upstairs bar area or darker, and larger downstairs dining room and bar.\n\nThe beer selection is decent - there's always something tasty to be had. They typically have a BBC on tap (at least the seasonal) and so far they're the only place I've seen that serves the Harpoon Belgian Ale. Well, at least they used to (maybe someone can correct me on this?). Their cocktails are also thoroughly enjoyable. My favorite is the Battle of Trafalgar, but if you ask nicely the bartender may concoct something special for you.\n\nFor food, people have raved about the burger, and I have to agree that it is amazing. It's not the best of all time (seriously, try the one at jm Curley) and I could go either way with the English muffin, but it's just so juicy and you can't go wrong with bacon. Other than that, I really like the local leaf salad (with figs!); the oyster selection is great; and the pizza is decent as well. Also this is the first place where I've tried bone marrow, which I enjoyed. Possibly my favorite dish though is the plate of jumbo shrimp. Well it says cocktail shrimp, but they're always JUMBO. You get 3 and they come atop of this cylinder of chopped up honeydew mixed up with some sort of spice.

The first two visits it was RHT as Wine Bar and then RHT as Beer Pub. Both times I sat at the upstairs bar and got better than decent recommendations from the bar tenders. The beer and wine lists are loaded with value that any beer aficionado or oenophile can cherry pick from.  Both list feature domestic offerings with a few local/regional choices. \n\nThe upstairs provides you a view of the Harvard Square car and foot traffic; it makes for mildly amusing diversion if you are on your own. I prefer the bar although the high top tables are a good option you might consider if it's crowded.\nThe down stairs room is what I prefer over all, I like subterranean venues. The bar is a large rectangle with a welcoming open atmosphere.  The rest of the room has booths and tables that are just slightly more densely packed than I would like, yet seating is somewhat intimate.\n\nThe food here is more towards the hearty side. It is rich and flavorful, and quite filling. Ingredients are fresh local products used in inventive ways. Without a doubt my favorite item is the oft spoken of poached egg, if you are an egg person you must try this. The beef choices here are all excellent, the burger is superlative. I myself am partial to the short ribs (Braised and the Wellington). The Charcuterie, and the salads are a nice lighter choice.  Pizzas are of high quality served piping hot. The only sandwich apart form the burger I've sampled was the Grilled Chicken, which is also a lighter choice.  \n\nI've yet to try the lamb, chicken, or duck, which I will soon remedy. The Raw Bar has been untouched mostly because I was not dining with people who like it as much as I do. I will certainly be back and update this review.\n\nThe service has been quite good with the only soft spot being the sometimes less than helpful hostesses (2/6 visits). The bartenders are very knowledgeable, the servers less so but they never failed to find an answer for me if they didn't know off the top of their head.\n\n* Truly a \"Tavern\" experience, albeit an upscale one.\n* On the expensive side but not without value for your dollar.\n* Try eating downstairs to get the full experience, and bring your appetite.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:46:14Z","yelp_user_id":"p8yQsVA51dzkc9cecDpvrw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:34:24Z","date":"2012-09-05","review_id":"7_p3yzWOHXdiAjcOlqxNCw","stars":4,"text":"Really good creative cocktails, and a menu that made me feel like I was back home in San Francisco -- full of well crafted small plates, giving credit to the ingredients.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can lead to a severe case of restaurant fatigue: on a recent Friday evening, when I asked a recommendation from the lady friend on where we should go for dinner, she responded, \"Seriously, anything that isn't New American or a gastropub,\" and I was worried that the whole cuisine had run its course.\n\nOkay, now that the depressing bit's over with, I will get right to the point: Russell House Tavern saved, for me, the concept of the New American gastropub, by honoring the roots of upscale bar fare with solid takes on a variety of categories of ingredients. \n\nStarting at the beginning, the house charcuterie board is an early standout. The increasingly-popular duck ham is wonderfully deep and gamey, the chicken liver pat\u00e9 is perfectly seasoned, and the Berkshire rillette converted even the most mousseline-phobic of my dining companions, but the real winner here are the paper-thin, ghostly pale, wait-what-is-this-even-meat slices of guanciale: these shavings of cured pork jowl will floor you with their surprisingly strong flavor given their slight appearance. (Also worth mentioning: if you find yourself running out of crostini upon which to place the quite substantial contents of this board, don't worry: the wait staff is on point and will provide you with additional supplies almost instinctively.)\n\nMore entree-esque options are, for lack of a better phrase, pretty amazing, and do a pretty nice job at illustrating why New American is still okay. As far as the New, the raw yellowfin tuna off the fairly deep raw bar menu yields a beautiful, well-stated tuna flavor; the cube of seaweed gelee and and slice of yam with a panko-esque crust on the side fill in nicely on either side of the spectrum of taste. If you're looking for the American, look no further than the R. House grass fed burger: large without being ridiculous, served on a toasted English muffin with cheddar, bacon and grilled onions, this is the essence of burger. (Pro-tip: If you've got any leftover spreadable components of the charcuterie board, save 'em for the fries. You'll thank me later.)\n\nAdditionally, as should be the case with any restaurant that puts \"-pub\" anywhere in its moniker, the beverages are certainly not forgotten here: Russell House Tavern offers an impressive list of bottled and draught beers (including Golden Monkey on-tap, always a welcome sight) all priced under $7. If you feel like getting fancy, they've also got larger bottles of stronger beers, as well as a rotating selection of cask ales. Also, the cocktail/liquor list is wonderful, especially where darker spirits are concerned: it's a pretty good call to set aside time for a 14-year-old Balvenie at the end of your meal.\n\nFurthermore, the atmosphere is exactly what you want from a gastropub: appropriately-dim lighting, deep brown leather banquettes, and centrally-located bars, all tucked away in two lower floors down an alley entrance off Harvard Square. Cozy without being lackadaisical, sharp without being intimidating: the perfect balance every establishment that calls itself a gastropub should strive for.\n\nSo, don't despair. New American is clearly alive in greater Boston, but it's definitely well at Russell House Tavern.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:19:02Z","yelp_user_id":"tPx4JTNt0w5ZvHcI4EZfcQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:00:36Z","date":"2011-09-26","review_id":"7ugLIA01GA8rxjwWRtRYCA","stars":2,"text":"This review is solely on their brunch service.

It was no problem, we were seated promptly. I was excited to try their sticky buns (as recommended by a friend) but the waitress advised that they had already sold out (it was 1pm on a Sunday). The menu really wasn't anything special. I had a large breakfast so I decided to order a few side dishes. My friends ordered sandwiches. The Egg BTL was good, but not great. The pork sandwich was large but not well seasoned. \n\nI ordered a biscuit, it arrived with a side of mint berry jelly.

I have a suspicion that their bread is frozen. \n\nWe were also not impressed with the hash browns. They were soggy and not crisp. They were also a orange color, not sure if they were sweet potato?

Alas, I do not and am limited to eating this delectably crispy, crunchy, velvety, smooth and rich egg but once or twice a month. \n\nSeriously, whoever thought of slow poaching an egg, then coating it in a layer of Panko crumbs, then deep frying without losing the runniness of the egg is a genius. Whatever you do, you have to get the egg. Just do it. GET THE EGG. \n\nOther dishes I've tried and liked/loved:\nBURGER- also mighty tasty (and a steal of an entree at $11, considering most other entrees are $20+). The beef is loosely packed and cooked to order (medium-rare for me) and the fries are a crunchy golden brown. \nSTEAK TARTARE - the quail yolk on top just makes this dish, but I'm not a big fan of the overly buttered toasts they serve it with. The butter overpowers the beef. \nCRABCAKES- solid, but with a similar crumb topping as the egg, this  tasted like a less amazing version of the egg. A good basic for less adventurous eaters.\nRILLETTE- decent  but with other interesting things to order I probably won't get it again. And I know duck fat is in, blah blah, and I love duck fat fries, but I don't exactly want to see a half centimeter thick layer of congealed fat on top of my food. \nOYSTERS- oysters were good, decently fresh and tasty. \n\nOh yeah, and they have lots of interesting drinks and beers too.

It was like driving a base-model Toyota without any of the optional bells and whistles. Very boring.\n\n2) The 'Salt & Pepper shrimp' was a soggy mess. Disappointing. And the only thing 'salt & peppa' about it was that I wanted to \"push it\" away from me.\n\n3) The 'House Made Cotechino Sausage pizza' is another supposed favorite.

Tonight, some friends (3 total) convinced me to give it another try.  Wednesday night around 7, we walk in.  Place is busy and we don't have a reservation.  No problem.  We put our name in, they say ~20 minute wait, so we grab a beer in the upstairs bar.  \n\nFast forward 1 hour.  We are now at the downstairs bar, having checked in with the hostess before that to see how we were doing.  \"20 minutes\" was the reply.  Well, we know that's not true, but no big deal. \n\nFast forward 20 more minutes.  The hostess tells us that \"a table is going to be ready soon\" and she is sorry for how long we've waited.\n\nFast forward 20 more minutes (a total of one hour and forty minutes).  We walk out with another terrible experience at Russell House.  We walked around the corner and got a delicious Felipe's Burrito for $5 in less than 2 minutes!\n\nNow having to wait for a table is not a big deal.  What is a big deal is how you are told repeatedly the same BS line of \"20 minutes.\"  If they were upfront with how long the wait was we probably would have just gone somewhere else.  I guess they lose business for that night, but it certainly would not have left such a terrible taste in my mouth.  Honesty is the best policy. \n\nThis place has lost my business for good.  It's too bad since it has so much promise, but it just appears to be managed by buffoons with no idea of how to run a restaurant or train a staff.  Great location, great beers, great ambiance, interesting menu, but just flat out terrible service from start to finish really is a deal breaker for me at this place.  \n\nNo more.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nMy first experience with Russell House was fine. I checked it out because it was a new spot in Harvard Square that thankfully wasn't trying too hard to be a high-end, pretentious place (i.e. Om) and it wasn't a complete dive bar (i.e. Tommy Doyle's).  It is a nice middle to upper range pub with a decent menu and a great space.\n\nTHEN I went a second time for a planned event to celebrate my friends graduating from grad school.  IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER.  I actually signed up for Yelp to write the review since it was such a terrible experience.\n\nFirst, it was a pre-fixe menu and we had to order ahead of time, which was fine. $45 seemed like a reasonable price.  When we get there they seated us almost immediately.  It was a large group of roughly 30 people.  We were told there would be two large tables set up in the basement so people could socialize and talk with each others families.  Once we sat down, the disaster began.  \n\nWe were broken into six small tables of 5 per person, not the two tables we were promised.  This basically meant that each family had to sit together without the ability to interact with others in the group over dinner.  Except, of course, the one family that had to disperse amongst the other tables because of the poor seating arrangement.  They didn't even get to sit with one another!  \n\nThe service was horrendous.  We didn't get bread or water for over an hour after sitting down.  First course salad came out an hour and a half after sitting.  Main course roughly two hours.  This was for a pre-fixe 3 course dinner where the order had been placed the day before!  \n\nOnce the food finally came, it did little to salvage the night.  One member of the party who was in from out of town and who claims to have never returned a dish before returned his fish entree because it was so bad.  I had steak frites, which should have been more appropriately named plate of french fries, as there were three meager pieces of poorly cooked steak.  Others seemed to have decent food, but nobody was blown away.\n\nThen, to top off the night, we get the bill and it averages $75 per person.  Where did the additional $30 per person come from.  Maybe half of the group ordered 1-2 cocktails and the others did not.  How does that math work out?  After asking the waitress how it all worked out she did not have much of an answer.  Then after speaking with the manager they reluctantly informed us (as if they were going to \"slide it by us\") that they added a 10% service charge on top of the 18% gratuity that they had already tacked on (the tip is totally reasonable).  The additional service charge was not disclosed to us prior to getting the bill.  After an hour of dealing with this nonsense we were able to walk out of that place with a disgusting feeling of a terrible experience.  \n\nI cannot recommend the Russell House in good conscious to any of my friends.  Maybe if you're just going to grab a quick beer and a bite to eat, but certainly not for anything more than that.  Like I said, I have always read Yelp but never contributed.  This experience was so poor that I finally felt compelled to Yelp about it and let people know to avoid planning any sort of event at this place.  But, if you do, you've been warned..","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:33:19Z","yelp_user_id":"lU_VKu4iW0SvAUGQu45Ocg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:42:59Z","date":"2012-08-25","review_id":"9ptztTrT02HYlzdpEjuc_Q","stars":4,"text":"Looking for a good place for lunch in Harvard Square, two of us walked into Russell House Tavern, an upscale pub.  Like other reviewers have mentioned there's both the small upstairs bar and patio area and a much larger downstairs bar and restaurant, where we ate.  The decor was very nice, although the one downside was the smell - there was something stale about the smell downstairs that definitely bothered us.  \n\nFortunately, the food impressed us - we'll definitely be back!  I got the arctic char nicoise, a very light, fresh salad with greens, olives, green beans, crispy potatoes, a large portion of perfectly cooked arctic char, and a light olive oil dressing.  I was in the mood for something light and simple, and this definitely fit the bill.  \n\nThe other entree was the burger with cheese, garlic aioli, and caramelized onions on an English muffin.  At first I was really concerned by the muffin - it makes a regular burger look much smaller, and I'm much more used to brioche or some other oversized bun - but both of us loved the burger, and in fact said it was the best we've ever had.  Now I know I've had amazing burgers all over the country, and I'm not sure I'm ready to say it's the best burger ever, but I will definitely put it in the top few I've had.  And the English muffin was perfect on it - just enough bread to hold everything together without overwhelming the rest of the burger.  \n\nAlso - check in on Yelp and get a free non-alcoholic beverage!  \n\nIn the end our tab was $25, which is more than we can afford to spend on a daily basis for lunch, but when you want something nicer than a quick bite it's definitely a good value for what you get.

This Harvard Square hot spot had come highly recommended by a food warrior friend of mine that has sadly relocated to Brooklyn. She told me that if I was looking for a phenomenal burger, that I needed to get my derriere to RHT. So, before heading to the Brattle Theater for some classic Alfred Hitchcock flicks, I grabbed my boyfriend and headed toward JFK St. To my chagrin, I was so unfortunately let down. \n\nThe atmosphere, I have to admit, is lovely. And if I was rating this place for decor and feel alone, it would certainly get 5 stars. It had a sleek interior with a high class pub feeling with throwbacks to a happier time. There is a smallish upstairs and additional seating downstairs. They had a patio in the alleyway next to the restaurant that reminded me of one of those random sidestreet cafe's in Europe. I was sold immediately and started thinking of the fabulous review I was about to write. Alas, man cannot live on decor alone. \n\nWe were seated in the lovely cafe area outside and were promptly forgotten. No worries, it was a beautiful day, and we were enjoying the shade. The menu was extensive and looked exotic with things like Crispy Pigs Head Cake and Smoked Lamb Belly Toast. I was super excited about the Short Rib Wellington. And my boyfriend got the highly recommended grass fed Burger. We intended on splitting both because we couldn't decide. To their credit, they split the plates for us. (I always give brownie points for this. It's such an easy thing to do and makes life MONUMENTALLY easier for us.)\n\nWe ordered the burger medium rare and it came out so rare that the inside of the burger came spilling out in a gloopy mess. We mentioned this fact to the server, and while at first she seemed to understand the extent to which this was unappetizing, she then asked if we wanted to wrap it to go. No, no we would not. The fries were ok, mostly overdone, but the ones that didn't snap in half were quite tasty. The Wellington was actually pretty good and a decent size for an appetizer. There was a lot of fat to the meat, but that's a hazard one takes when ordering beef. The pastry puff tasted like plastic. The apples were a pleasant and delicious surprise. However, as rich as the food was, it was missing that kick that would have made it delicious.\n\nThe food was just a tad overpriced. We didn't eat the burger and received no apology, no visit from a manager, no adjustment on our bill. I was a little disappointed. The server was very friendly and once she got to our table, she was attentive. The beer selection was decent. Not too many draughts but a healthy bottle selection. However, I don't think I'll be coming back.

Everything is lit up and decorated, and people are in festive moods. The Russel House Tavern was no different, and played nothing but Christmas music (annoying for some, but welcome for me!)\n\nThey sat portions of our party of 5 and allowed them to wait at the table for the rest of us, which was great considering one person was stuck on the Red Line at a few stops, and I had to wait extra long for a bus after one broke down.\n\nOur waiter was attentive and not overly friendly.  There was always a full water bottle (tap) at our table once we ran out.\n\nThe drink menu is extensive and creative.  I was excited to see all the different drinks with St. Germain, but stuck with my old standby, the St. Germain cocktail (St Germain and bubbles), rather than getting it with something stronger.  It was a school night, after all.  The wines come in low ball glasses, which other reviewers scoff at, but I liked the glasses, and appreciated them not wanting gesticulators (me) to knock a full glass over too easily.  \n\nApps were small, except the one I ordered.  Yellowfin tuna looked great but had 3 small slices with a tiny cube of seaweed gelee (only tasted the seaweed, which was very good.)  Fried oysters come with 5 breaded morsels on top of a spicey orange sauce.  My mother responded \"I guess we aren't in Essex anymore\"! referring to the fried food restaurants near the beach that pile breaded bivalves on an enormous platter.  The fois gras was a normal-sized portion of this dish that I've seen elsewhere, but I didn't taste it.  I got the melted cheese appetizer, that comes with mushrooms and carmelized onions and entirely too many toasted pita wedges to justify with the small-ish tray of cheese and veggies.  But oh-so-delicious.\n\nI went out on a limb and ordered the Char, a fish I don't think I have ever had before.  Very impressive.  Cooked to perfection, it resembles salmon in color and somewhat in taste.  It was served over a white sauce that seemed buttery and garlicky, more mushrooms, cooked apples (decent, but didn't really belong), with a pine nut mix on top.  SO good.  I practically licked my plate clean.\n\nThe table split sides of grits (SUPER) and french fries, which weren't crispy enough for me.  My sister got brussel sprouts and they were awesome.\n\nFor dessert, we all split the molten chocolate cake and the trio of sorbets.  Apple Cider Sorbet tasted like the real thing, fresh from the orchard.  The cake was unappealing to the eye (it kind of resembled a chocolate desert, as in sand and dry air, not sweet post-dinner course.)  However, it was indeed molten, the ice cream scoop on top was good, and the ginger-caramel sauce was a wonderful accompaniment.\n\nI definitely recommend Russel House.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:49:04Z","yelp_user_id":"hKwc4stxEQYartm3Q9c74g"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:24:54Z","date":"2012-03-27","review_id":"AGstIfiHitH5D-cBOoKEow","stars":5,"text":"I went here on a date recently, and fell in lovee with this place!!

We went with two of his friends this past weekend and had the opportunity to check out more items off the menu.  This time was even better than the last. \n\nWe started with their deviled eggs, which had a kick of heat to them (spicy, but tasty).  We also ordered a dozen oysters, which were very good (fresh).   We slurped them up quickly.  On to the entrees.  One of our friends had actually already eaten dinner a couple of hours earlier, so he wanted something light.  He ordered the Beet Salad with the crispy poached egg (from the small plates menu).  He said the Beet Salad and egg was really good.  He actually went on and on  about the Beet Salad  (and I don't think it was just the bourbon talking).  He seemed to really enjoy it.  Our other friend ordered the pork trio, which had pork belly, pork shoulder and some other pork (I forget which).  I tried a portion of each type of pork and damn, I think I will order this next time I go.  It was really good. \n\nAs for my boyfriend and I....  he tried (and loved) the burger.  I also ordered the burger, this time with a side salad instead of fries.  I also got an order of the honey brussells sprouts to share with the table - - everyone was shocked that brussells sprouts could taste this good.  I think next time I'll pass on the side salad and just stick to the sprouts - they are really that good.  Weird, I know.  \n\nThe service was just OK - my boyfriend's burger was brought out with a side salad instead of the fries he had ordered, but that was quickly remedied (they left the salad, but brought out a large bowl of fries for the table....all the better for me to steal some.)   My only real gripe about the service was that it was slow and surley.   Our waitress seemed put out by our drink requests; she just seemed unhappy.  At one point, later in the evening when we were enjoying after dinner cocktails, I asked her, \"are you trying to get out of here and are we keeping you?\", thinking perhaps we were her last table and that would explain why she was so annoyed.  She said no, but didn't seem to change her attitude.  We still tipped her well, but honestly, after a $400 tab for dinner and many (many) drinks, would it kill you to smile? \n\nI won't ding the restaurant for one sourpuss waitress. The food was just too damn good.  It's funny, because we live in Somerville and all of us were saying \"this place is what Foundry could have been, if only their food didn't suck...\" (If you are local, you'll probably understand that statement).

I will never again patronize Russell House or any of their affiliated restaurants, including Temple Bar and Grafton Street. \n\nMy husband and friend got together to plan a dinner party for my birthday. They chose RHT, in part, because I really liked the food last time we went and it has a nice vibe. The reservation was made last week for 15 people. Surprisingly, I am actually more popular than I anticipated and the guest list ended up being more like 20 people. My husband called RHT as soon as possible (on Monday or Tuesday when the last burst of RSVPs came) to notify them and was told that we would no longer fit into their private room and would now need to sit in the regular restaurant. OK fine, no big deal. They then told him we would have to have a limited menu. Again, not a problem. We understand that they don't want to have to potentially prepare any given item off the menu. \n\nWhen we contacted RHT to set the limited menu, we were then informed that it had to be a prix fixe menu. Jigga wha? That's entirely different than limited menu. And on top of that, it was going to be $45 per person for a 3 course meal. Now, I'm not objecting to prix fixe menus generally, but springing that news on someone the day before their event is completely unacceptable. Ericka, the event coordinator, told my husband that they had to have a prix fixe menu because the restaurant wanted to guarantee a certain amount of revenue -- which, of course, we probably would have hit just with drinks and food alone, but being restricted to 2 courses to hit the mark doesn't work for our crowd. \n\nCalls to Ian, the general manager, went unreturned for quite some time. Again, not a problem if we weren't 24 hours away from the event and we wouldn't possibly have to find another restaurant to hold 20 people on a Friday evening. \n\nIan, after dodging our phone calls for a couple of hours, was obviously super helpful (sarcasm) and said that it was the restaurant group's policy that there be a prix fixe menu for any large groups of 15 people or more...which is apparently not true since our initial reservation was for 15 and the restaurant was told at that time that there was a real possibility that we would add more people.\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with the circus at RHT unless you really like dealing with idiots. Save yourself the trouble and book any large parties at Daedalus, where the management is not inept and they actually welcome your business.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:04:02Z","yelp_user_id":"ktjmbOd3beXjOiahRGn_sA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:13:22Z","date":"2012-01-15","review_id":"B0MJJ-yZA79M9sIk7rSLNg","stars":4,"text":"I have heard very, very good things about Russell House Tavern, mostly focused on their drinks and brunch. And I will say that when I went for drinks and dinner, I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is a little corporate, but that's something that plagues pretty much any nice restaurant/bar in Harvard Square. It is pleasant, and spacious, and though Russell House is often packed on the weekend, it isn't overwhelming once one is seated. The service was excellent, as our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Russell House also gets bonus points for the complimentary sparkling water, which is one of those oh-I'm-not-in-New-York moments for me. It's a nice gesture, and gives Russell House a little bonus point for classiness.\nAs for the drinks, I tried two different cocktails, and had a sip of my friend's two drinks. Each and every one was  a little different, but they all were excellent in flavor, yet packed a serious punch. I didn't get to try any of the beers on the list, but that list was lengthy and promising, plentiful enough to encourage me to return for more sampling.\nWe both ordered the chicken sandwich with 1/2 fries, 1/2 salad. That 1/2 sides option is nice, and the sandwich was excellent. It wasn't exactly the most original flavor I've had, but it was certainly good and something I'd be happy to eat again. I've heard good things about the burger, and about their cheap oyster happy hour, something I would very much like to attend. However, this is where I get to the not-so-good part of the review, which is that their average entree price seems pretty steep for a tavern/pub, even in Harvard Square. From the offerings listed, the pricing seemed like a bit much, and definitely limited my ordering options.\nAll in all, I would say that I'd be happy to hit up Russell House for more drinks and perhaps those oysters, but their dinner options beyond the sandwiches are pricier than they might be worth. I would like to try their brunch options, but when it comes to dinner, I'll come back to Russell House only when I want a burger or delicious but rich grilled chicken sandwich.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:08:05Z","yelp_user_id":"EshrtQQT0ODnFpGkU2DWKA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:01:33Z","date":"2012-02-21","review_id":"b1jU5XwW1F8To-lIi_mRIg","stars":4,"text":"Very eclectic cocktail menu and fun appetizers/tapas style food.

She had a Dutch Summer, which was really fruity but delicious; I had a Trafalgar, an odd mix of liquors (I usually take a simpler drink) but good and strong. \n\nDon't discount the food. While not their strong point, we're still talking about a pretty upscale place here, and the food meets this standard. We had a spinach based dip with some pita-esque slices, which was great and came in a large enough portion to be a meal in itself. She had a 'dirty' Caesar salad, which was good but came adorned with anchovy infused croutons (I guess that's the dirty part?), which neither of us were brave enough to try. I had the roasted Giannone farm chicken, which I must say was incredibly tasty and perfectly cooked, though not terrible inventive. \n\nThe atmosphere (on a Saturday night) was busy but not overcrowded, speaking in a medium tone of voice, outside was nice as you are in a sort of alleyway where you may watch people walk past, look up at the ivy overhanging your table, etc. \n\nRecommended, particularly for the drinks.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:45:03Z","yelp_user_id":"VCHm6qQSsDlYdlcfKH05Ow"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:31:04Z","date":"2010-07-05","review_id":"BAQTwkf7lHrKNXrOvhLUPg","stars":3,"text":"\"the food was great, but the service sucked.\"  \n\nthose words were resonating through my head, reminiscent of the operations management course i was enrolled in.  maybe it was the time we arrived at the russell house tavern, situated conveniently right in the heart of harvard square.  it was much later, and the bruins playoffs were preoccupying many of the patrons who seem to know many of  the staff who worked there.  \n\nwe were seated at one of the high tops by the window, which featured an outstanding people-watching vantage point.  this was part of the smaller upstairs with its storefront, supplemented by an enormous downstairs with another bar, similar to the old z square interiors.  the lighting was pleasant and really set the mood.  \n\nthe menu consisted of high-class bar food, such as oysters on the half shell and the charcuterie plate, items that make regular appearances on our table when we do get out to the bars.  the beer selection was equally impressive, with beers that were not well-known.  they also had a cask-conditioned ale, which was unfortunately kicked five minutes prior to our visit.  \n\nwhat irked us was when we were seated and provided menus to muse over, the server appeared quickly and just stood there.  my boyfriend did not even know she was there as he was too busy going over the menu.  we needed a little more time, so she disappeared to get our water.  in fact, she never came back with the sparking water she offered, and my boyfriend had to get someone from the bar to provide us with some regular water.  she was apparently serving the whole top floor, while two hostesses stood around chatting with each other.  \n\nwhen the food arrived, we thought the food was outstanding.  in fact, we kept needing more bread for the charcuterie plate that we were trying to finish off.  asking for more bread was challenging, especially for someone as impatient as i.  our server would put the order in for more bread, and someone else from the kitchen would come out with the bread perfectly laid out on a trendy rectangular plate about ten minutes later.  we really just wanted more bread.  \n\nour server disappeared for a long time.  we wanted the bill.  we were there for probably two hours for a late dinner on a school night.  we will go back for the food, drink and atmosphere, but be warned of slow service.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:19:54Z","yelp_user_id":"ChR0ljPe23NbStuYxWncJw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:14:14Z","date":"2011-10-25","review_id":"BbqDbzSakLohoNqZ0-XjnA","stars":5,"text":"Came here for restaurant week.

It especially paired well with the jelly spread that came with it. The bone marrow is one large bone sliced down the middle with a saw and cooked up in a delicious kind of manner. I could hardly get this one away from the wife. One criticism of the small plates is that, while delicious, they were incredibly greasy. We loved them while eating, but after the dinner had that queasy, too-much-grease feeling.\n\nFinally, the burger. It's simple: english muffin, caramelized onions, bacon, cheese.

The almonds -- they are on the menu for a few bux, and totally worth it -- hot, spiced so well, deeeelish.\n-Negative contributors: was a bit pricey, also vegetarian options are reeeeaaallly limited (not surprising when you consider it's a gastropub, but surprising when you consider the surrounding population).

We waited it out at the upstairs bar, and after at least 30 minutes, went to check on our status. They floundered and said \"oh, it'll be another 20 minutes...\" meaning they had most likely forgotten about us.

The waitress apologized for the long wait, saying it's not usually that busy on a Tuesday night.  Then she said she would bring bread, but informed us they were out of bread, and would try to find some from the back. The bread she brought out was very cold, but tasty with the oil. My date ordered and oyster, which the server placed in front of me (not a problem, but lack of attention on top of the wait made it stand out in my mind.)  He got the burger and I got the chicken and mashed potatoes.  Both of our meals were very good and mine provided leftovers.  I also had a St. Germain cocktail, which was made beautifully over crushed ice in a tall glass, and highly recommend it.

To begin with- the layout of the restaurant itself is loft meets speakeasy. You walk by on the street to the open windows of what seems like a tight space to clink drinks and flirt with the good looking bartender- but what's hidden behind the first floor bar is outdoor seating and a large staircase leading to a beautiful, dark restaurant and bar with cushioned chairs circling the room and some of the friendliest service in an upscale (but casual) restaurant I've been to.  The service (from the hosts to the bar tenders to the manager) are incredibly warm and friendly- and the menu makes it difficult to just settle on one thing (so we settled on sharing everything we ordered with one another).

The service was top notch, the atmosphere was lively, the drinks were tasty, and the food was spot on.  Nothing else I could want on a Friday night.  \n\nThe bread that came out after we ordered is served with an amazing herb olive oil.  We ended up dipping into it with everything, fries, bread, you name it, it was great.  Our party ordered the Andria pizza as a starter.  This is a must order.  The thin pizza is perfectly cooked and the little figs are a perfect pairing to the garlic and burrata.  \n\nFor dinner, we were a little non-traditional, and ordered a bunch of items to share.  We got the special of the day fish which was fluke, and the char, as well as a charcuterie plate (the fig spread was the stand out pairing for the plate), gravlax, steak tartare, and some lobster sliders.  The fish were cooked perfectly, and the spaghetti squash on the char was something we were fighting over.  The tartare was some of the best that I've ever had, seasoned just right.  The lobster sliders were so delicious but too small for how delicious they were, I think next time I'm just going to order a bunch of them until I enter a lobster coma.\n\nWe finished dinner with some sorbet trios.  Incredible.  We were served a trio of pear, apple cider, and currant, and let me tell you, it had no time to even begin to melt.  Their other dessert options looked delicious too, but we just had no room for anything heavier than refreshing sorbet.\n\nOur server was extremely well trained, and knew the answer to all of our questions. She was very pleasant and checked in on us at just the right times, despite a very busy evening and a few large tables.  I would say Russell House has some of the best head to tail options in Boston, which may turn some people off.  I say give it a shot!  You won't be disappointed.

I choose the Pork Trio which had a selection of 3 cuts cooked 3 different ways - loin, belly, and shoulder.

The wait itself wasn't long, but it was how the host handled us and other patrons that bothered me. There was a group of about 7 who had lost their reservation (probably for showing up late), so they took up most of the waiting area. The host looked at the computer (presumably at table availability) in between trying to keep the group of 7 calm and answering multiple phone calls. He did not seem like he had a good handle on the situation and walked away a few times to see if any tables were available (isn't that what computers are for?). He was apologetic, and since I was just with one friend, we were able to get a table on the first floor (we had to share one of the long 6-person tables with stools though). Sitting on stools for dinner is annoying, but we dealt with it.\n\nLike I said, the food was a saving grace. We had the fried poach eggs (delicious, but not worth the price) as well as the crab cakes ($13 for two). The crab cakes were very rich and flavorful.\n\nAs a main course, I had the ale braised beef cheek. At $24, I expected a little more food, but it was nonetheless delicious. It was tender and the sauce was sweet and went very well with the meat and sides.\n\nThe beer selection provided a good variety (mostly domestic), as I had one of the rotating beers of the week(?), Victory Oktoberfest.\n\nThe food I give 4 stars, but the service gets 2, so this averages out at 3. Service was slow (it took a good 5-10 minutes before we first saw our waiter), and there were points throughout the meal where we were sans any potables. I also witnessed a few tables left uncleared for a considerable amount of time after patrons left, while other customers were at the entrance waiting to be seated.\n\nI'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were a victim of circumstance that night (it was Hurricane Irene weekend, which was very mild in Boston/Cambridge). It also seemed as if they had random people clearing tables and bringing out food, so it's likely they were just short-staffed that one night.\n\nThis is neither here nor there, but to top off the whole experience, the table next to us was full of drunk girls, one of whom kept breaking into song at the top of her lungs (she did not have a Broadway-caliber voice).

Most of the food is from a 20 mile radius of the restaurant and the wine list is all American. \n\nHonestly you should stop reading now and go straight to the Russell House and order the Charcuterie Board. \n\nGot there in a snow storm around 8pm on a Friday and it was Halloween weekend. A little wet when we arrived  and were seated right away. The server was knowledgeable of the menu and it was un-recited and suggested multiple menu items. I wasn't impressed with the entree list but I think that was because of the amazing appetizer and small plates menu that overshadowed it. \n\nWe ordered the Tap Wine which was for the novelty and thank god because it was on the level of Rose Franzia...which I'm not knocking but it has it's time and place in another setting, such as squeezing the unboxed bag contents 10 feet into your half naked friend's mouth. The server was knowledgeable about the wine menu also but tried to up sell us the most expensive wine in the house which I caught quickly, applauded silently and ordered a Lagunitas IPA in spite but this review isn't about the server it's about the food.\n\nWe ordered the Charcuterie Board, Short Rib Wellington, Ox Tail Ravioli's (3), and Cambozola, mushroom, onion flatbread.\n\nThe cured meats included duck breast pancetta, rillette with a topping of creamy duckfat that melted beautifully on a room temp plate, hog cheeks, it also had a prune-honey jelly that added nice depth when needed after bites of pate. \n\nThe short rib wellington was done perfectly with puff pastry and filled with chucks of tender short rib and juicy mushrooms. We were mixing combinations 20 different ways with our nice little spread of decadence. I scooped off the duck fat and let it melt into the demi from the Ox Tail Ravioli and it almost took my breath away at first bite. Which each breath the air dragged heavily along my tongue and cheeks. WOW !\n\nJust an all around great atmosphere and decor. The place screams Nouvelle Americana which is what this menu should be called. I forgot to mention the cocktail list which was very tempting and filled heavy with Whiskey's. I even saw a 21 year High West Rocky Mountain Rye. I also saw one of the creations called a Wigglesworth which included Maker's Mark 46, Fernet Branca, Apple-cinnamon, and Maple Bitters and I am kicking myself in the ass now for not getting one. It hit me when we went for drinks at a local pub sipping on Harpoon which you can get anywhere in Boston. \n\nIf you want out of the ordinary but classic and clean then this is the place to go.

A stressed out bartender makes me feel guilty for contributing to his/her workload ... which is unfortunate at the tail end of a busy week when I'm dying for a cocktail. Yes, I got one (two, in fact), but the service felt almost begrudging.\n\nThe food, however, made me very happy! Highlights:\n\n-- Jumbo shrimp with a honeydew-serrano-avocado salsa. Actually tasted healthy, and very refreshing.\n\n-- TUNA CONSERVA. Best dish of the night. The fregola and radishes were punchy and very nicely textured, and the tuna was almost reminiscent of a good bacalao salad: firm, seasoned, and not too oily.\n\n-- Steak tartare. Nothing unique, but perfect with a wee egg yolk (quail, I'm assuming) and a just-crisp-enough round of toast. We could've done with two toasts, actually, but we got the small plate vs. the app. Presumably the app would have more.\n\nNot sure I'll order the roasted vegetables with herb pistou again -- the butter was overwhelming.\n\nThere were also a couple of service-related puzzlers that weren't deal breaking but worth working out:\n\n-- I ended up with two knives and two napkins. After our appetizer, the bartender gave us another full set of napkin-wrapped silverware, rather than simply replacing what was already used. We awkwardly placed the second napkins on our laps for lack of a better solution. Weird.\n\n-- And while I greatly appreciate a sense of urgency coming from the kitchen (our food came out in a flash), the waitstaff was flitting around that place like hummingbirds on speed. Getting out of my bar seat was like easing out of a NASCAR pit in the middle of a race (first and last NASCAR reference I'll ever use in a Yelp review, I imagine) -- and I almost got mowed down by three of them en route to the restroom. Afterwards, I couldn't help taking note of it for the rest of the time I was there. I mean, yeah, it's busy and people want their food ... but at that pace, someone's gonna get hurt! \n\nIn sum, I'm very much looking forward to going back to Russell House -- with my game face on, so I can eat more, drink more, and work it off by dodging the high-octane waitstaff.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:57:14Z","yelp_user_id":"EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:29:58Z","date":"2011-11-12","review_id":"FP6y0H2NFCwV1OQk_fSMEw","stars":3,"text":"I like this place.

Never before have I seen such dedication to customer service from an establishment with such a moderate price point.\n\nNow, outreach is all well and good, but follow through is where you really win over a guest who has previously had a bad experience. Did Russell House win me over with their follow through?\n\nPlease turn up your speakers for a resounding YES!\n\nDuring our email correspondence, Tyler went ahead and set up a reservation for Henry (my date) and me. When we arrived, he was waiting by the hostess stand, where he greeted us warmly before leading us to a great table they had set aside for us.\n\nOnce at our table, Tyler took our coats and checked them for us. He then proceeded to talk about the restaurant's operating philosophy, and how they strive to keep the food and wine as local as possible. After taking our drink order, he informed us that he was going to send out two complimentary small plates to give us a sense of what the restaurant was all about.\n\nThe first of the small plates was the Oxtail Pierogi, which is a type of dumpling made with unleavened dough. The second small plate was the Burrata, which is served with pistachios, currants, and crispy shallots. Both dishes tasted fresh and were extremely flavorful.\n\nWe were introduced to our server after we finished our first course. She was very nice, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. When Henry, who is a Wisconsonite, asked about the cheddar used on the grass fed burger, she not only knew that they use Cabot 6 month cheddar, but also took it upon herself to have the kitchen use a nicer, older cheddar instead. Talk about customized service! I ordered the Roasted Giannone Farm Chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and thyme roasted carrots. \n\nBoth of our entrees were delicious, and very filling. Come the end of our meal, neither of us really had room for dessert, and we initially declined our server's offer because we didn't see any sense in paying for something that we weren't going to be able to finish. However, when our server gently pushed us by offering to bring us something on the house, we accepted. The surprise dessert was rather unconventional -- a plate of cheeses, fruit, and a few different types of spread. I stuck mostly to the blackberries (which are my favorite fruit), while Henry indulged his Wisconsin heritage by tasting and identifying each of the cheeses on the plate.\n\nThroughout the meal, Henry and I were surprised and delighted by the quality of the service and the excellence of the food. The final surprise came at the end of the meal when Tyler informed us that our meal was on him. This was completely unexpected, and both Henry and I were completely floored by this generosity.\n\nI will definitely return to Russell House Tavern, and would highly recommend it to friends and family. The staff and management have an exceptional grasp of what it means to provide great customer service, and this service is backed by an inspired menu and a fantastic culinary team.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:32:32Z","yelp_user_id":"2RxLnR_c3okdSNburyg5qA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:51:54Z","date":"2010-05-23","review_id":"FYcNRyDSgDhHOCiK93Umog","stars":5,"text":"Love it! I've been in to Russell House several times and it's been consistently excellent. I've been in for a casual dinner, just drinks, snacks and a beer, brunch, a Yelp event, and a big private party -- and it's worked wonderfully for all of them.\n\nYou're looking at a variety of delicious food options ranging from ~$5 snacks to ~$30 entrees, classic and original cocktails, an excellent beer and wine list, pleasant seating, and a lot of casual hang-out space. \n\nThe fish of the day is not to be missed, the raw bar kicks ass, and the burger (especially in the \"Harvard Square Happy Meal,\" where it's paired with a tallboy of Brooklyn lager and a shot of Fernet) ain't bad either. I'd be remiss if I were not to mention the $5 Westport Rivers wine on tap, which is also quite a draw. The charcuterie plate for just over $10 is a standout offering as well -- the pate and duck prosciutto are perfectly salty, buttery, and rich, pair amazingly with the fig jam, and the staff are great about bringing you more crostini that you'll inevitably need to get every last bit of cured meaty goodness into your mouth.\n\nIt's definitely worth stopping in for brunch, too; the brunch menu is filled with hearty, delicious options for very reasonable ($8-15) prices. (Also highly excellent: \"The Quickening\" brunch cocktail, consisting of Rogue Dead Guy with Amaro Meletti and Chartreuse, a shot of Fernet, and a plate of bacon. Good morning, the weekend!)\n\nSimilar to the food and drink options, the space is very varied -- there's an airy upstairs bar area with a couple large tables (perfect for brunch!), and an expansive basement space with a large marble bar, a couple large tables in a space that can be curtained off for private events.\n\nOn a side note, I hosted an alumni gathering here for my alma mater and the staff were really friendly and great to work with -- big ups to Maggie and Ian for putting together a great event and to everyone at Russell House for providing consistently great experiences every time I'm in!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:35:05Z","yelp_user_id":"Eu9t9pDcGADgtNNs7h8UMw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:34:18Z","date":"2011-03-04","review_id":"gAgG0njIauK-E0_w_dZC7A","stars":5,"text":"This place rocks. \n\nThe house made charcuterie plate is delicious and generously portioned and the crispy soft poached egg is insane (in the best possible way).

I do not think my review can do it justice. \n\nDo not let the word \"tavern\" or its location smack in the middle of Harvard sq fool you. The food at Russell is spectacular, perfectly executed, and very flavorful. The food is complimented by an excellent selection of craft beers, wine, cocktails and liquors. (Lately I have been into tarty gin drinks and the Southside hit the spot.)\n\nThe menu reads like wish list for any meat or seafood lover. There are small plates, appetizers, a raw bar section and entrees. The entrees top out at about 25 though many are under 20. The quality however is on par with places that charge in the 30s. \n\nMy group started with the charcuterie plate and the steak tartar with a quail egg (did I mention we love meat or what?) The charcuterie included the best chicken live pate I have had - very light and complemented by a honey grape chutney/jelly. It also included a rillete, trout pate, some smoked ham and duck perscuito. Many of these can be gotten separately form the small plates menu. The steak tartar was delicious. \n\nI had the pig three way, which came with grits and greens. The grits were creamy and wonderful, not \"gritty\" and were a perfect complement. The pork loin was the perfect balance of fatty and meaty, whereas the pork belly was a bit too much for me, but others enjoyed it tremendously. My friend's steak frite was a perfect medium rare and my husband's artic char was seared to perfection - very tender with the skin crispy and floating on top. \n\nAfter the meal I definitely needed an immediate nap - since I pretty much feasted on glorious pig and other animal fat. It was totally worth it. \nOh and did I mention the service was delightful. Our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing. ...and sparkling water carbonated in house is free. \n\nAnyway - all carnivores must go here. Do not miss it.

Bad decision.\n\nI ordered the American Egg Plate: 2 eggs (scrambled for me), bacon or sausage (bacon for me), home fries, and wheat toast. The home fries didn't have much flavor on their own. At least they came with ketchup on the side. A couple of the bacon strips had char marks on them. I HATE charred food. The toast was fine, except that it wasn't served with any jelly or jam. The eggs were also fine, but I like my eggs with salt and pepper, and there wasn't any on the table.\n\nThe food was served by someone other than the waiter (a runner?), who promptly left the table after serving the food, so I waited for the waiter to come by to check on us. After about 3 or 4 minutes (way too long of a wait), the waiter came by, and I asked for salt and pepper, and jam or jelly. He brought a small salt grinder, and they didn't have any small available pepper grinders, so he brought a big grinder that he took away after dispensing some pepper. That's fine, but, really??, you don't have a salt and pepper grinder for every table when you serve eggs for brunch?? Wow. And the jam that came for the toast was some kind of berry jam that had no flavor whatsoever.\n\nThe only positive thing I have to say is that the \"2 eggs\" looked more like 3 or 4, so you'll definitely get enough food if you order this dish.

The pigs head came out looking like an arrenchini ball, but with pigs head meat instead of rice. Crispy and savory and surprisingly light. The serrano ham was salty with just the right amount of sweetness. The bone marrow was straight buttery goodness. The only problem is that the bread that came with the bone marrow was buttered and overpowered the bone marrow at times. Switching the bread that came with the serrano ham fixed this problem for us. For out mains I got the burger that I've heard a lot about (which when I ordered, the waiter told me it's on an english muffin and alot of foodies have been slamming the chef about using the muffin) and Abby got the duck.

Underwhelming.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:53:02Z","yelp_user_id":"j9Wf7fnD8z7gACsFgQGdLA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:39:22Z","date":"2012-03-26","review_id":"hekEmUXOfJEUfc0Y3tCk2g","stars":5,"text":"I took my wife out this Saturday night and decided to go to the Rusell House Tavern.

Get your eff'in pink #@%$ off my property! You're nothing more than a White Zinfandel masquerading around as something you're not! Thelma, get me my shotgun! \n\nConfused? Don't be, because this IS a review of the Russell House Tavern, and a very positive one at that. However, if you will allow me the indulgence of pontificating for just one moment about a subject that is very important to me, and to our society of gourmands and oenophiles as a whole. Allow me to discuss the topic of wine relations. \n\nSometimes considered taboo, wine relations is seldom discussed in public, but it is something we should not ignore. Many of you may be too young to remember when the rogue Ros\u00e9, White Zinfandel, emerged upon the American wine scene, and the subsequent damage it caused for decades to come. Scenes like the one illustrated above occurred on doorsteps and in restaurants across our great nation, and I remember them vividly as some of the darkest days in our country's young wine history. Sides were taken, lines were drawn, opinions and tempers flared...there was real threat of an all-out revolt against White Zinfandel, and legitimate blush wines were caught in the crossfire. \n\nFlash forward three decades, and time has healed many of our wounds. Our fragile wine culture has recovered, grown stronger, and moved beyond the days when we allowed ourselves to be force-fed inferior, overly-sweet wines, mass produced by large corporate agribusinesses. We have come to realize our prejudices, and we have recognized that the history of blush wines can be traced back to the traditional wine regions of France. We now appreciate that blush wine can be good wine. \n\nYou may ask, \"Why Steve? Why are you drudging up such an arcane subject matter from a bygone era?\" The answer, my friends, is because the Russell House Tavern boldly chose to proudly display three American blush wines on their wine menu. This is foretelling of a day when blush wines will assume their rightful place among American wines, but this cannot happen without the cooperation of the American consumer. Now, I am not saying that blush wines will be the next big thing, because that would be foolish. After all, no winemaker intentionally sets out to make great blush wines, but rather it occurs as a fortuitous accident. Perhaps the climates and soils determine that a red varietal happens to make a really decent and drinkable Ros\u00e9, rather than the Pinot Noir that the winemaker had hoped for. Lucky for us, the true beauty of blush wines is that they pair well with just about everything. \n\nFor example, a perfect complement to a Ros\u00e9 is seafood and spice. So, under the Russell House Tavern's raw bar menu, you might select the Jonah Crab Claws with ginger & harissa aioli, which is a tremendous steal at six claws for $14. We ordered this, and the crab was cool and sweet, while the aioli had the perfect amount of peppery heat. Other natural Ros\u00e9 pairings include pork and poultry. I've never hidden my love for charcuterie, so we ordered the House Charcuterie Board, which contained chicken liver pat\u00e9, duck ham, Berkshire rillette, and Serrano ham. We fawned over this appetizer, savoring the sweet, silky richness of the pat\u00e9, the smokiness of the rillette, and the delicately thin, cured hams. The portions were generous enough that we had to request additional crostinis in order to enjoy every last morsel of our charcuterie board. We rounded out our meal with the Dirty Caesar Salad with spicy anchovy croutons. The greens were fresh and crisp, the dressing was creamy and tart, and the croutons were delicious on their own. \n\nThere is a quirky little thing that my wife and I do when we are enjoying a meal. We move our upper bodies as if we are dancing to music that only we can hear. This happens when our taste buds are overloaded with flavors beyond what our synapses and taste centers can process, and so we respond bodily. Weird yes, but both my wife and I caught each other in phantom dance as we consumed our food at Russell Street Tavern. It was REALLY that good, and inexpensive, and therefore a tremendous value. On the beverage front, the Russell Street Tavern has a wide selection of American wines and craft beers, and inventive cocktails. Russell Street Tavern occupies the space that previously housed Z-Square, and they did very little to change the d\u00e9cor. They really didn't have to, since it had been well decorated with marble bar tops, dark woods, and modern styling. In general, I found the cuisine and the beverage list at Russell House to be perfectly tailored to almost any palate or budget. I'll definitely return to continue my tour of the menu. And I thank the person who is responsible for including blush wines on the wine list for standing up for wine relations.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:42:44Z","yelp_user_id":"EFZzbJQfhQAuDOLGaJbecg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:01:58Z","date":"2011-03-07","review_id":"iM-RJJ9vtDz_XEeqqlcE_w","stars":3,"text":"I really want to like Russell House... the second that I saw their menu I was excited to try out this fun looking restaurant that had menu items such as chicken liver pate, bone marrow, a charcuterie board and steak tartare. Yes, I like the \"gross\" dishes on menus! \n\nMy first time walking into Russell House I loved the decor. Trendy yet still totally comfortable feeling. We were seated promptly and ordered all of our dishes without a hitch.\n\nHowever, we had some problems with pacing. We ordered a variety of small plates and then one entree to share. And then despite the fact we tried to get them to course the food out...everything just came at once making us feel really rushed. Everything tasted fine, and during this visit, I felt like the quality of the food and effort that had gone into it was worth the price. \n\nGiven my generally positive feelings I decided to return for a celebration dinner. Sadly, the same dishes I loved months before seemed a bit weaker and rushed in preparation. For example, the cut of the meat in the steak tartare. Additionally, same service problems of tons of food, then no food. And this time, everything seemed to be waaay to heavy on the butter (and I'm a butter lover). Even worse, this time I was seated on the banquette and was so close to other tables I could have been part of either of their conversations easily.\n\nAlso, the wine issues folks seemed to have were echoed in my experience. I don't remember what wine I ordered but when it arrived I felt like it tasted odd. Later when I got the bill, surprise I had been given the Benziger Pinot Noir which I really dislike. They were nice enough to take it off, but I wish I had been given the wine I wanted to begin with. \n\nAfter my second experience I don't think I'll be back again except maybe for a quick cocktail and small plate in between harvard square activities.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:27:58Z","yelp_user_id":"w8eT6HYs1CkNI3mRCZQjHQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T17:49:42Z","date":"2010-05-17","review_id":"ImXP1pLwP8mGXCZdJdTGSw","stars":5,"text":"Russell House Tavern, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Cocktails - Oh yes, they've got classics, they've got their own stuff going on, and they have got great bartenders coming from other awesome restaurants. Go, imbibe, rejoice.\n\n2) Flexible food menu - Akin to Highland Kitchen, they have a huge variety of offerings that will satisfy many different needs. You've got your friend who only eats salad, one who wants a simple burger, and someone who wants a really great entree - and Russell House has them all. Plus there are the sides, apps, and little plates that mean that you can try a lot of stuff. Also, it's delicious.\n\n3) Pork joy - that's right, this place is about taking the most delicious (most fatty) parts of animals eat making delectably rich dishes that make you feel like a sinner. Lamb belly, charcuterie, you can have it all.\n\n4) Awesome drink options. Wine on tap? $4 shots of Fernet? Pitchers of St. Germain cocktail? That's right. They know what is fabulous, and they want to share.\n\n5) Classiness - hells yeah. But maybe I'm not the best person to comment on this topic.\n\nAll in all, I'm super excited for this restaurant, and I plan on going back a lot because there is so much to eat and it is all so good.

Lets start with the fact that me and a friend in our party of five arrived first, he took our drink orders before the other three and then did not bring us drinks until everyone had ordered. I'm sorry thats a no-go.  If I'm going out, I want my cocktail in a decent  time frame.  And while we're on the topic of drinks, for my second round, I ordered a glass of pinot blanc. After an extremely long time, he brought me a glass of prosecco and in what had become known at our table as his notorious enthusiasm exclaimed, \"they even put it in a different glass for you!\"  I realized it was prosecco by the bubbles rising within the champagne flute and informed him it was not wine, it took another 10 minutes to even get a glass of wine.   I'm sorry, but any knowledgeable server should be able to recognize at least the difference between wine and a sparking wine/champagne and the different glassware. \n\nOther qualms: someone in our party ordered an appetizer as an entree and it came out with the appetizer course so she was done by the time the entrees arrived.  Someone's entree salad came with nothing on it- it was supposed to have walnuts and figs on it and instead it was nothing but lettuce. The  Steak tartare came out as a small plate size instead of the appetizer size that we ordered.  My entree came out  between 5-10 minutes  later then the other entrees.  The food was decent, everything was pretty over salted though.  Oh and lastly we split the bill between two credit cards and it legit took about 25 minutes because they didn't know how to use their micros system.\n\nI have to say that my biggest qualm amidst all these mistakes, many of which were totally forgivable-- was that never once did a manager come over to apologize or comp anything from our bill and our waiter was MIA for large periods of time.  \n\nI might give it another chance, sometime, in the far far off future, but there's plenty of other great places opening or open that will bury Russell House Tavern if they don't work out their kinks ASAP.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:24:30Z","yelp_user_id":"oq9SsN5jcvSUWbQmysmpsg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:11:43Z","date":"2012-05-24","review_id":"IQvZHv9e4DP6KPKgo-hcmQ","stars":4,"text":"Looking for some decent eats in Cambridge? stop by RHT.

Thursday. 7:30pm. Myself, Laura K, Caitlyn L & Erin\n\nWhat was ordered:\n- Caitlyn L went with the 3 course pre fixe (heirloom tomato salad, a HUGE pork chop with quinoa and something chocolate for dessert....for 33 bucks, she couldn't resist and according to her, all was fantastic.\n\n-Laura K went rogue on the restaurant week menu (as did I and Erin) and  went straight for the kill, ordering the coveted \"chip in egg\"-a soft poached egg which is then lightly coated in a seasoned panko and then flash fried to a crisp. The end result, a crispy exterior encompassing a rich and luscious egg yolk, perfectly oozy. I could have stuck a fork in her, because she was doooooooooone....so good! Following the egg was the steak frites. She loved it as well.\n\n-Erin went for the roast chicken which was such a great dish. Very comforting, very much like mama use to make. Roast chicken with roasted carrots and a decadent potato puree. \n\n-Myself, deciding on a small caesar, which ended up being tasty, HUGE, and not to mention perfectly dressed and not smothered in dressing...bonus. I also, like Laura K, went for the steak frites. I personally felt the portion of meat was a bit lacking, seeing as it was 2 thin slices of meat, and not actually a steak, but regardless, it had great flavor. \n\nRound 2: Birthday boy Damien S's \"I added an extra year to your birthday card on accident, don't hate me\" birthday lunch. Saturday. 2pm.\n\nOk, so this is where the \"Squishie\" comes into play.\n\nWhat was ordered:\n\n-Damien S did it up with a \"Maria Basilico\" bloody mary, featuring hints of fresh basil, horseradish, and cucumber. Refreshing, intriguing, manly...like an old spice commercial, minus the foul scent. His little birthday heart had fallen upon ordering some sort of chicken sandwich with fancy sauce on it. He liked, as did I, but we both agreed it may have been a tiny tiiiiiiiiiny bit dry, but barely. \n\n-Myself, the idiot who added a year to one of her best friends birthdays, had the almighty \"Squishie\", a fantastic concoction of champagne, orange juice, st. germain, and a splash of something else but damnnnnnnnnnnnn son, it was amazing. I then indulged myself in ordering the 16 hour brisket sandwich, topped with coleslaw and house made pickles. The train to flavor town had definitely pulled into the station.\n\n*Service was better on the second visit than the first but that's to be expected when you're not in the middle of restaurant week.

We started off with some classic St. Germain's and Moscow Mules while enjoying the COMPLIMENTARY bottled sparkling water (as a Perrier enthusiast, I was sold). We were having a casual night so we ordered a smattering of apps to nibble on though we ended up polishing off most. Our favorites were the Creamy Spinach Gratin and House Made Cotechino Sausage Pizza but the Short Rib Wellington and Dirty Caesar are hardly second tier selections. \n\nWe ate in the quaint bistro area upstairs and enjoyed the people watching in Harvard Square and the lively din of the place without even realizing the existence of an entire dining room beneath us. This was likely the same setup from the days of Z on the Square however I'd never been to the space prior to that evening. I was pleasantly surprised on my trip to the restroom by the subterranean grandeur of the formal dining room. I was not-so-secretly jealous and almost asked our server to move us down there despite being more than halfway through. Speaking of the staff, they had clearly received the \"let's go get 'em team!\" pep talk at the beginning of the shift .

Great beer/wine selection, good food, and the drinks on the menu are great.  The bartenders can be a little hit or miss on off-menu cocktails though and I'm fairly sure they don't carry \"flavors\" so probably not the best place if you want one of those super fruity/sugary concoctions.

It was a nice day for the patio and not crowded in the late afternoon.\n\nBUT AVOID $1 OYSTERS AT NIGHT.  They are served after 11 pm so that's a risk that you have to be willing to take. I've gone down that road before and come out unscathed but this time around, I wasn't so lucky.  We went for a late dinner and had a few small plates.  The farm eggs are quite good!  My BF ate his oysters all from one plate while my friend and I ate mostly from another plate.  BF was fine but my friend and I both got food poisoning the next day.  I noticed that with each oyster shell, there was a tiny piece of the shell that I had to spit out.  That should have been a tell tale sign that they weren't cleaned well when shucked. \n\nThe oyster quality is significantly higher earlier in the day but that's what you get for wanting to save some $ at a place where the price point is too high.

We sat for 1 hour, 15 minutes waiting for our food. We watched everyone around us get served, then even watched one party leave and the NEXT party be served, all before our food came. \nIn all that time, our waiter/bartender never said a word to us -- in fact, did all he could to avoid eye contact and avoid helping us; even ignoring us the first time we said we were ready to order (we figured he wasn't our waiter and was going to get the correct person) -- and we only got helped when another bartender overheard us asking each other if perhaps our order hadn't been put in and helpfully checked on it. \nWhen the food finally came out, 2 of our 6 people had warm, tasty meals. The other four had cold eggs, missing side orders and, in the case of the two others, had cold, rock-hard toast for our melted cheese sandwhiches that the menu said would be served on \"griddled brioche.\"\nA manager showed up at one point, very briefly, and started with \"I know you don't want to hear this, but our kitchen is really busy...\" Looking around the room at all the other people eating, we couldn't help but point out -- politely -- that the busy kitchen didn't seem to have trouble getting anyone else served. When we asked about the (cold, toasted, rock-hard) sliced bread used instead of brioche for the sandwich, she said with a totally straight face \"that is brioche.\" Really?! She said she'd sort things out, then disappeared.\nWe continued to wait (by this point, at least we'd eaten, even if most of the meals were served cold) with no more communication from anyone until we finally stopped the waiter in his tracks (as he tried to walk by again without making eye contact) and asked if we had a bill. After 2+ hours, we'd be hanging around the place long enough.\nTo their credit, they billed us about $13 for brunch for 6, which had included 2 alcoholic drinks. \nBut the lack of communication from the staff -- never once did our waiter acknowledge that our food was late -- and the poor communication from the manager on duty won't have us coming back any time soon. What a bummer.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:53:27Z","yelp_user_id":"FJmMusLr4qnQ3v_xFiUdeg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:39:15Z","date":"2010-06-10","review_id":"KCU9oXF1Nw4ZJCUAbhuHXg","stars":2,"text":"To start, I was *really, really psyched* to go here based on the recommendations.  I've wanted to go since it opened, since it's in a great location and about five minutes from my apartment.  I booked a reservation via OpenTable, and had dinner there tonight with my boyfriend.\n\nGot seated, Thursday night at 7:30, upstairs was almost packed.  Server seemed pleasant and gave us our menus, we ordered cocktails, then took a few minutes to decide on a menu.  No bread.  Not a huge deal, but weird when the people sat after us were given bread immediately.\n\nWe decided to order two appetizers/\"small plates\" - got the crispy poached egg and the pork rillettes.   The egg was amazing.  The rillettes were way over seasoned, and a mush as opposed to the slightly more stringy texture I'm used to.  The bread it came with was terrible - far too brittle.\n\nDrinks were fine.  The house rum was really nice, and the Moscow Mule was done well.\n\nNext came dinner.  I had the steak frites medium rare, he had the burger medium.  Steak frites, which was supposed to be an 8oz cut, was two pieces of meat, maybe 6oz at best (with about 2 pounds worth of fries, likely to hide the fact there was so little of the steak - plating is also not a strong suit here).  It looked to be cooked perfectly, but upon actually tasting it, it was luke warm at best, as if it had been cooked first and sat out - OUT, not under any sort of heat lamp.  Not to mention I had to wait a few minutes to hail the waitress to ask for a steak knife.\n\nThe steak itself tasted like it had absolutely no seasoning, and the \"demi\", while a nice color, tasted nothing like a reduction.  It was more like a dark, watery sauce out of a bottle.  The combination was not pleasing.\n\nThen the fries - they were cut like steak fries but were overall pretty limp.  These, like the rillettes, were overseasoned.  At this point it seems as though Russell House is suffering from Goldilocks Syndrome.\n\nThe BF's burger was - \"Pretty much like Applebees\" - not what I'd hoped to hear from a somewhat upscale restaurant, but not surprising given the incredibly lackluster entree I had.  I ate my steak and a handful of fries, he ate about 1/3 of his burger, we didn't take anything to go, nor did the waitress bother to inquire why.\n\nWe decided to give them the benefit of the doubt with dessert, and I'm glad we did.  He had the sorbet, I had the carrot cake bread pudding.  The bread pudding was out of this world and pretty much the reason for the second star.  The sorbet trio was okay, but the pink grapefruit sorbet was pretty much unpalateable. \n\nOverall, we were both really disappointed.  Service was lackluster, food was lackluster to poor, drinks were good.  I may try Russell House again in a few months when they've had a bit more time to get in the swing of things, but otherwise I would probably stick to grabbing a drink or two from their impressive selection of alcohol and share a small plate or two as opposed to plunking down $100 for below average food and service.\n\nUsually, when I'm this excited to try a new place, I overlook a lot and genuinely want to like things.  Either I've matured from that phase, or Russell House disappointed me so badly I couldn't even go that far.\n\nEDIT: It's now five hours later and I've been to the bathroom FOUR times, and not due to the drinks.  I honestly would assume I was right about the steak sitting out.

The seafood was room temp or warmer, and fishy.\n\nFood wise, my girlfriend had a typical veggie/mushroom omelet with hashbrowns type affair.

I even liked the chicken liver pate which I usually leave to the boyfriend to demolish. My only complaint would be that I'd like some sort of pickled item to cut through the fat.

I sat down and waited a few minutes before my friend came, then we had to wait another 5 minutes before anyone came over for the first time. Water was dropped off at the table, with no mention of taking a drink order or questions about the menu.  Finally, someone came back to take drink orders: a Harpoon Oktoberfest and Pinot Noir on tap.  *Another* five minutes later, and the server came back to ask us to show her Harpoon Oktoberfest on the actual menu because she couldn't find it on the computer screen.  *Another* five minutes later, and the drinks came from a new server (still no food order taken): a Harpoon Oktoberfest and Pinot Blanc.  I mentioned that I ordered the Pinot Noir to the newest server to come to our table (this was the third one we had seen in the 20 minutes we had been there, and we still hadn't had the opportunity to order) apologized and offered to take our order.  I asked what the daily terrine was and she had no idea, so she promptly left to find out.  *Another* five minutes later, she comes back with my wine and offers to take our order.  Again, I ask what the daily terrine is and still doesn't know.  FINALLY she comes back knowing what the terrine is - a foie gras, which sounds good and I order that and the crispy egg, and we split the spinach gratin starter.\n\nThe food came promptly, but it was highly disappointing.  The spinach gratin was overpowered with garlic (even for myself, a true garlic lover), and the terrine was incredibly salty.  After the main courses arrived, we were given the complimentary bread that should have came with the drinks we waited 20 minutes for.  The bright spot was the crispy egg, which was delicious.

Whether I went there for a Yelp Elite event, for drinks or for food I've noticed many inconsistencies in either the food, the service and/or the drinks.\n\nWhile I think that Aaron Butler, their bar manager, is a phenomenal staff member, one who's expertise was finely crafted and tuned at Barbara Lynch's Drink before he moved to RHT to takeover their bar, I think that their drinks have been hit or miss a lot of times. While they've nailed some of my drinks, often times they haven't been nearly as good as what I've paid for. It's just been inconsistant; I'll order a Vieux Carr\u00e9 and it'll be excellent but then I'll get it again the following week and it won't taste nearly as good. I can't explain why but consistency is key in this case and I have yet to find it there. Another big disappointment in their wine on tap. While the concept is great, I've had two glasses of wine from their innovative, forward-thinking mechanism. One of Pinot Noir and the other of Pinot Blanc; Each time I could only have a couple of sips before discarding the rest because of a metallic-like aftertaste in each sip. While the glasses were only $5 each, it clearly wasn't worth it as the wine was mediocre at best.\n\nOn the upside most of their cocktails are affordable for the quality that you receive and will be worth it most of the time. \n\nAs far as the food there goes, I've experienced both their regular dinner menu as well as their bar menu. The neat thing about their food is that the value is usually pretty great (except for one item, but I'll get to that a bit later) and they have all kinds of offerings, including  a raw bar. I've had their house burger which is a pretty solid meal in itself but when I ordered the roasted bone marrow dish from their bar menu I was extremely disappointed; while it tasted good, the portion was TINY! A half a bone. At $9. There's no way I'm doing that again, I felt like such a sucker. \n\nSo despite my few complaints, why give it 4 stars? Well for one, the RHT fills a gigantic void within the neighborhood. Very few places offer a solid selection of cocktails, wines and beers and accompany them with worthwhile food options. And in this case, the place remains a neat, well decorated, casual but slightly upscale option where  you can go have a few drinks with friends or have a meal. Just be careful as to what you order as the value is not always there.\n\nInconsistencies aside, they do have some nice deals for the oyster loves in you.

Here, the beer selection is always good, the cocktails are even better, and the wine is on tap. The food moves well between incredible charcuterie and ($1 late-night) oysters and just-as-good sandwiches and burgers (I'm afraid I've never splurged on the more-expensive entrees, but I'm sure they're excellent as well). The atmosphere can be a little dim during the day if the patio is closed and you're not next to the windows, but as long as that's not the case, it's cozy, and the staff has always been friendly, chatty (in a good way), and welcoming.\n\nRussell House is my cornerstone restaurant in Harvard Square; even now, writing this review across the country, I wish I could dial up a friend, head down, and put back a cocktail or two (or three or four) over oysters, make some bad decisions, and add another memory to the list.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:53:37Z","yelp_user_id":"beBLlmKPlCkrpnPXJzlw1Q"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:58:55Z","date":"2012-04-30","review_id":"mgv4I8BnYZA4kiIN7C0b1g","stars":4,"text":"It was my first time in to Russell House Tavern on Saturday night and thanks to the small plate design, I can say I had a really good cross section of their menu.

LOVE.\n\nBack in the day, when this was just a crappy Z-Square restaurant, I hardly noticed this spot, squeezed as it is between Papyrus and Citizens Bank.\n\nBut then, one glorious glorious summer (2010), Russell House Tavern (hereafter, RHT) was established, and I began spending most of my evenings cosied up at the upstairs (i.e. ground floor) bar. Allow me to explain why...\n\nService is awesome. I am a big fan of the bartenders called Nick and \"Sparkle Pony\". There are a couple of Aarons and, I believe, a Chris. All these guys have consistently served me well. If I have ever ordered anything I didn't like here, my dish has been whipped away efficiently and replaced with something far more delicious, all at no cost to me. This is true both of drinks and of food.\n\nSpeaking of food I didn't like here: they do some crazy bone marrow dish that, quite frankly, I would give to a dog but not to a human. But no one forced me to order that dish -- I did it, on a whim, and when I disliked it, it was replaced immediately. I'm not removing one star from my review because I found a dish I didn't like: I'm not so monomaniacal to assume every restaurant should only offer on the menu that which I personally want to eat...\n... especially because there is so much food here that I love.\n\nThe Charcuterie Board is divine. Unless you KNOW you love the rilette, ask for the Board without it. I often replace the rilette with a small spoonful of the Steak Tartare. MAN, the tartare is good. Other great things? You can never go wrong with their soup du jour (only served at lunch, alas), their Caesar salad, and my GOODNESS you *have* to try their crispy poached egg. And the lamb. And the duck. Beyond awesome.\n\nThe pizzas are totally delicious, but by far I love the oysters. Oysters oysters oysters. Shucked and served on ice in front of you at the bar. Did I mention that it's only $1 per oyster after 11pm? Yes, that's no typo: ONE DOLLAR PER OYSTER after 11.\n\nFinalement, les beverages. They have pretty much every kind of wine and beer you could ever want... perhaps minus the most mediocre sort. The bar staff are great mixologists (I say PAH to you who prefer the overpriced, yet similarly delicious, cocktails at Drink) and if you're eager for something new... ask them for an \"Anouska\".\n\nThat's right, kids and kittens, they (unofficially) named a cocktail after me :) Do you see why I love this place?","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:43:42Z","yelp_user_id":"1jWX85cb5FAN78WbLJTUZA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:43:32Z","date":"2010-05-30","review_id":"MmEZE3y9SEX1TXaNDDOE9g","stars":4,"text":"I noticed the Russell House Tavern for the first time today (Sunday brunch) when running some errands in Harvard Sq.

We settled on the R. House Grass Fed Burger and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  The burger was 8ounces of perfectly cook ground beef served on an English muffin with cheddar cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. It was very juicy and a tad messy but it was very tasty. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich with an edamame and pecorino spread, pickled red onions, fried shishito peppers and arugula on a focaccia was a bit different but equally tasty. I enjoyed the variety of flavors that both entrees offered.

Our servers have been attentive and knowledgeable, and we've never waited too long for a table. It can get pretty loud, but it's spacious enough that it's not usually a problem. And I have to say I'm still blown away every time I walk in there by what they've done with the space, which has had some less-than-memorable places there in the past. Russell House Tavern has managed to create an atmosphere that fits right in with the vibe of the Square and makes it seem as if they've been there for years. Highly recommend.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:32:11Z","yelp_user_id":"Oe4WJnQK4rYgMQX-9ZTCxA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:05:33Z","date":"2010-07-08","review_id":"mX1o6fMAO2wumgbmASxoZg","stars":4,"text":"I got to Russell House Tavern around 5:30 pm on a Thursday, as I entered to see if my friends were there yet the hostess gave me a warm greeting. She suggested that since my party wasn't there just yet that  I could be seated without them or I could take a seat at the bar. \n\nSo I bellied up to the bar where I was promptly greeted by the bartender with a menu. I decided to try the Pinot Blanc on tap (admittedly mostly for the novelty of wine on tap). I know little about wine other than what tastes good to me, so I won't pretend to but I will say I liked this wine. The upstairs bar area was mostly full without being packed. There seems to be plenty of room on the first floor, but I can imagine that when it's busy in there it's sometimes hard to navigate through to get to the basement. \n\nOnce my friends arrived we were seated right away. Our waiter was eccentric but very friendly. He was quick to offer suggestions, though some of his \"help\" wasn't really helpful. \n\nI had done my research prior to arriving- browsed the menu on their blog, read the Yelp reviews, read the local media reviews, and local foodie bloggers. I pretty much knew what I wanted before we even arrived. I ordered the Crab Cakes (appetizer portion - $10), Short Rib Wellington ($10), and the already infamous Crispy Soft Poached Chip-In Farm Egg ($7). Our waiter even asked how I'd like my 3 choices to come out; all at once, as their ready, or some other combination. I asked his suggestion and so we decided I'd have the Crab Cake as an appetizer and the other two plates would come with my dining companions' entrees. \n\nThe Crab Cake was good but certainly not the standout dish of the night; served with a sweet pickle tartar and an apple slaw-like salad. The sweet pickle tartar was a great compliment to the crab cakes.\n\nWhen my remaining two dishes arrived, I was so excited for and curious about this egg I'd heard so much about that I decided to eat that first. It looked good; still in an near perfect egg shape sitting on a nest that included toasted brioche and pancetta. The melding of flavors in my mouth was so good. Even deep fried the combination is light tasting with just enough crispiness and plenty of flavor. I now see why this has been the most talked about item on the menu. \n\nFor me however the real standout of the night was the Short Rib Wellington. This dish was served in a small cast iron bowl. The chunks of braised short ribs were so tender they just about melted in my mouth, full of flavor. Along with the beef was small chunks of braised apple and mushrooms; the apple gave an almost sweet after taste that I think really positively contributed to the flavors in this dish. And to top it all off, there was a crispy, flaky puffed pastry sitting on top. I don't think I could eat more than this \"small plate\" of the Short Rib Wellington since it was so flavorful, but so long as it's on the menu I'll definitively order it again.\n\nThroughout the meal our waiter was attentive, checking back to see how I liked the egg and to see if we needed more drinks or dessert. \n\nIt's not an inexpensive restaurant but it certainly falls in the affordable mid-range category. For 3 meals and 3 alcoholic beverages our total bill came for $84. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:09:18Z","yelp_user_id":"0-1pVi3JcsIaXkUs-sTNtQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:12:51Z","date":"2012-06-29","review_id":"MXbGM5XC4be3UFC5jRIbdA","stars":3,"text":"I want to give them a 3.5 and share 3 separate experiences with you.

I personally wasn't feeling the mascarpone- the texture with the combination of strawberries, etc. was weird. It was a not so great paste.The terrine wasn't very flavorful. I don't recall what it was as it changes often but it was a very traditional terrine which would have been ok if Strip T's Terrine didn't blow it out of the water. \n\nOn another note: The outdoor seating is great if you're able to get one.

I might have jumped the gun a tad, and after thinking it over a few days, I'm not sure it's better than the one's ahead of it. Most of the burgers have received very mediocre scores from yours truly, but there are some standouts, and while my initial instinct was to go over the top, I kind of overlooked some past favorites. Which isn't to say the burger at Russell House isn't great, it is, but do I like it as much as Toro, Miracle of Science or Flat Patties? Close, but no cigar. I don't hand out high remarks easily, the top burgers have earned their place, in my opinion, and this is absolutely one burger I will be back for. Located right in the heart of Harvard Square in a stunning space, to me, this is what pub food and atmosphere is supposed to be about. It's modern, clean, and the menu is downright enticing, with something for everyone. The burger is priced at a very reasonable $10, served on a griddled English Muffin, with charcoal onions, bacon, and cheddar. I was pretty nervous about the English Muffin, which I don't normally enjoy and was worried it might be too thin for a burger. But, much to my delight, it actually holds up fairly well, a little hard to handle in spots (ie too hot in the middle because it's so thin) but griddling helps it form a crust which gives it much needed structure. The meat has good flavor, is noticeably beefy, but the bacon is a real afterthought, almost undetectable. And that beef, while tasty, is very overcooked in too many spots, as long as it's flavorful I'm happy, but overcooked meat dries out, and this burger just had too many overcooked spots. The homemade aioli was wonderful, a perfect foil to both the fries and the burger, and despite having only a handful of ingredients, there is a ton of flavor from start to finish. Also worth mentioning was the amount of char on the burger, I like some char, but for me, too many of the components (all of them really) had that charred flavor, to the point where things become bitter and consequently one note.The Russell House Tavern has a lot of things going for it, great location, great burgers and affordability, everything you could ask for in a casual restaurant. It may not be the best burger in Boston, but it's certainly right up there.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:58:13Z","yelp_user_id":"Mv3j5XmDmA_pqcPnWiUwgw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:36:07Z","date":"2011-05-03","review_id":"ovFf_Q7aQNWZS21VN5DXUA","stars":1,"text":"I hear over and over how Russell House Tavern is supposedly this amazing restaurant with wonderful service - but I have yet to experience this.\n\nI went to breakfast several weeks ago at RHT - I found the service to be fine, but nothing fantastic.

We were debating between a few spots, but finally decided on RHT, because we hadn't eaten there before and we wanted to try somewhere new.\n\nSad to say, I totally regretted our decision.\n\nFirst off, there was an problem with our IDs -- our waitress actually had to take ours inside to show her manager, explaining there was some sort of \"server test\" an agency or management was running at the restaurant, and she had to be EXTRA careful to not get in trouble. Weird excuse, huh? I have an under-21 MA-issued license, which was probably confusing to her. I mean, I wouldn't have minded so much if it didn't take 15 minutes for her to come back and say we were good to go, and another 10 minutes for drinks to actually come out. We also waited a whole 'nother 40 minutes for our food to come out, while watching the tables that were seated way after us get their orders first. I mean, if you want to test your servers or whatever, couldn't you do it in a way that doesn't effect your customers?\n\nSecondly, the food was completely hit/miss when it did finally come out to us. We ordered four small plate/appetizer items off the menu. The first two dishes to get to our table were the crispy soft poached egg (miss: it was cold and *not* crispy) and the grilled prime rib knuckles (hit: perfectly seasoned and tender, loved the roasted pumpkin romesco!) After another strange lull in waiting, we got our third dish, citrust and juniper-cured gravlax (miss: epically). Now this was really the final straw: it was completely inedible, so much so that it felt like we were eating pure salt. Our palates were SO overwhelmed that we decided to cancel our final order, which was the beef tartare, and call it a night. Our waitress did take the gravlax off our check, which was appreciated (actually, I'd be very upset if it wasn't...)\n\nAt the end of the meal, the GM did come over and acknowledge the food/service was spotty. He explained there was a private event being held in the downstairs space, so restaurant flow was a bit off, and apologized for our terrible experience. He also said he tasted the gravlax and agreed with us, and pulled the item from the menu. I'm glad he came over and spoke to us, but I don't think I'll be going to RHT again. Overall, it was just an incredibly uncomfortable experience with the whole ID ordeal, long wait and the disappointing food.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:54:33Z","yelp_user_id":"c5cliVazw532ND6Fp0V4Vw"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:43:53Z","date":"2010-09-19","review_id":"queS-a7V3STHu-Zgk0mBoA","stars":5,"text":"I came in once for a birthday party.  I came in again this weekend.  Both visits were absolutely awesome.

I could hear him as I was sitting closest to him, but my friend sitting further away had a hard time hearing the specials.  I opted to go with the charcuterie plate, and the white wine on tap.  Yep, wine on tap. AND it's delicious and $5.  I was feeling like reigning in the spending, so I opted to go with the wine.  My parters in crime ordered cocktails, which were fantastic.  \n\nThe charcuterie plate is pure magic.  I can say with 100% certainty that it's the best plate of meat you can get in Boston.  The plate comes with chicken liver pate, port rillette with delicious duck fat, serrano ham, and  duck bacon.  It comes with an herbed jam, and lots of little toasted buttery crostini.  It was pure magic for $12, and Steve anticipated our needs and brought more crostinis for us before we needed them for smearing our delicious meat fats.\n\nI highly suggest this place if you're wanting something delicious in Harvard Square.   The prices are also beyond reasonable and the portions are very generous.   I also suggest sitting downstairs, as the upstairs can be filled with a younger college crowd, unless that's your thing.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:47:34Z","yelp_user_id":"u4wMEPl-I1FHGHrKaK12yA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:47:58Z","date":"2010-12-12","review_id":"qWNdKDahXnDq3tiwJZ790A","stars":2,"text":"After a few hours of errands in and around Harvard Square, I dragged my fiance to Russell House for brunch, assuring him that yelp said it was good.

My brunch, however, was completely inedible. I ordered \"The Pit Master\" (a mistake in the first place, I don't know what possessed me to think that yankees could pull off any sort of bbq). It was described, \"Hardwood 16 Hour Smoked Brisket scrambled with Three Eggs, Grilled Scallions, Fontina & Roasted Potatoes. Toast.\" \n\nProblems: there was no brisket in the dish, only huge cubes of squishy beef fat that I initially mistook for the above mentioned roasted potatoes. So already I'm paying $11 for a dish that doesn't actually contain any meat. In addition, the scallions were raw, not grilled, and I was unable to find any roasted potatoes in the \"scramble.\" The toast, far from being anything interesting, was the plainest, slightly burnt wheat bread imaginable (worse than anything I would purchase from a grocery store for my family). All of that would have been bad enough, but the eggs pushed this dish from unappetizing to inedible. They were so undercooked that completely raw egg was pooling up in the bottom of the skillet the dish was served in, making the bottom of the toast unpleasantly moist. Unfortunately for me, I didn't discover the raw egg until several bites in, and I have a medical condition that precludes me from consuming any type of undercooked/unpasteurized animal products. Needless to say, I've been absolutely sick to my stomach since I left RHT and paid for a lunch I did not remotely enjoy.\n\nI'm sure Russell House serves better dishes than this one, and they seem to be doing some interesting things on their menus, but I doubt I will be returning for more of their \"raw\" selections...\n\nIn the future, I will go with my gut and stick to Pinocchio's.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:53:22Z","yelp_user_id":"-xTj9CMKkk2wKSZ-P1VYtg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:40:13Z","date":"2011-11-12","review_id":"qWTswt5I0-SusEOwySJGVQ","stars":3,"text":"Burger was OK, it was served on an un-toasted English muffin that took away from the actual burger.\n\nTried an Oyster.

I have lived in Cambridge amongst many other Ma cities. Recently I was \"home\" and was lucky enough to have my gorgeous GF(brownie pts) with me and wanted to show her how we get down in the bean with some serious grub(that I tell her about ad nauseum) . Rather than taking her to my old haunts I asked a trusted friend to recommend a new place for us both to experience. This is my FIRST Yelp review.\n\nRussell House Tavern is a pretty cool New American gastropub in the space that formerly housed Z Square in historic Harvard sq. The menu created by Executive Chef Michael Scelfo has something for everybody,from a finicky kid(burgers,pizza) to a seasoned foodie(charcuterie,gravlax),and truly has multiple gems on it. I truly enjoyed everything I ate and would've had seconds(if my belly allowed) of each dish. If it wasn't entirely clear so far, I had a bonafide 5 star experience here for sure and would highly recommend it to everyone. I am happy to have popped my \"yelp review cherry\" on an extremely positive note! \n\nFor starters RHT achieves a style incorporating both modern and traditional american elements very much like it's city and neighborhood. Yet it isn't at all pretentious and has a wonderfully light and energetic ambiance. It occupies 2 levels. Up has a cozy bar(W/friendly funny bartender Vic) and even a little outdoor patio. Down is the main dining room with a lively bar and restrooms. Where the old tenants (Z sq.) couldn't  quite make this space work, RHT  did and it has a hip buzz in the air that the former was aiming for. \n\nThe menu is large but you don't get lost reading it and is very well rounded.Included are , assorted Appetizers,Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Pizza, Burgers, Raw Bar, Small Plates, Entrees,  and Desserts . \nAs far as beverages go, aside from in house filtered flat/sparkling h2o(nice bottles too) and the usual suspects of non alcoholic drinks it boasts an above average and extensive signature cocktail list,has a refreshing exclusively domestic Wine list(many sustainable), plus local and domestic Craft Beer in both draught and bottles. \n\nLet me tell you what I ate now in no particular order of course(and very briefly explained for lengths sake):Seared Scallops w/Beans & Pork Belly,Oxtail Peirogis,Beef Heart Ravioli,Lamb's Belly Toast,Lobster Sliders,Beef Tongue Meatballs,Crispy Pigs Head Cake,Crsipy Soft Poached Egg w/pancetta,Warm Burrata Slad w/Brussels Sprouts,New England Cheese Board,Carrot Bread...Phew! \nTo not bore you with too many more details everything was SPOT on delicious. Standouts where Lamb,Oxtail,Lobster,Beefheart,Pigs Head,& Carrot Bread. \n\nTo sum it all up, Mission Accomplished! We hit the Trifecta, great food/drink in a great atmosphere and had great service too(Kate Penner who was informative,attentive, & charming). All this without being pretentious or stupid expensive. The only downside(omnivores disagree) are extremely limited vegetarian options. \nOh and l almost forgot to mention they have $1 Oysters 2-5 pm & 11-Close WOW!!!! The cherry on top certainly was the classic hip hop playing. \nReservation recommended.\n\np.s.

Let me repeat... I NEVER go into Harvard Square. It seems like it's always something. Parking is a disaster. I can never just walk into a place an get seated in less than 40 minutes. And I saw a guy pee in the street once and let's just say it, where I live you don't really see that every day. It just seems like I always choose the wrong time for a date with Harvard. \n\nSo how did I find the Russell House Tavern? I was kidnapped. BIg Love kidnapped me and said \"just trust me\". Hmph. It never really works out. Usually that phrase, from his lips, equals failure. Though I do love him dearly. So I trusted & he paid for parking :)\n(um, just keep reading, the story counts as a review because at some point, I really do review this establishment)\nOkay... So...\n\nWe happened upon the Russell House Tavern. It was between RHT and some other place across the street. I couldn't decide so my husband said \"pick a hand\". Unlike \"just trust me\"... this phrase usually works out for the best :)\n\nI looked at the menu on the side of the building and \"grass fed beef\" caught my eye. It was a sign. I told Big Love and we frolicked in together.\n\nWe were greeted by two women who seated us right away. (could I have been wrong about Harvard?) Moments later our waiter - a very polite, witty & handsome in a different sort of way fella - came over and asked us if we wanted water. Still or sparkling. I love water choices. LOVE. I don't like MAKING choices. But I LOVE having choices to make. We chose sparkling and looked through the menu. I can't remember the waiters name. I'm going to call him Smiles. He didn't smile a ton, but I did like his smile. It was very warm.\n\nThe atmosphere was really something. Beautiful leather bar stools, romantic lighting and pictures from the 20s and 30s lining the walls. I loved the old photos of Cambridge and Harvard Square.\n\nThe menu was very unique. Everything from the appetizers to the side salads just looked interesting and delicious. We couldn't decide, it all looked too good. In the mean time the waiter and I discussed the drink menu and we decided I should have the St-Germain Cocktail. I'm absolutely obsessing over Elderflower Liqueur right now. He told me it would be \"refreshing\" and it was! My best friend had made the same drink at her Birthwarming celebration a few months prior. (Birthday/Housewarming... creepy huh? I love it.)\n\nAnyhow, we decided on the Grass Fed Beef Burger (medium-well) and the Steak Frites. Any burger with bacon and an English muffin needs to be mine. \nSmiles came back with some bread and olive oil. Usually I don't love olive oil for dipping. But THIS olive oil was ridiculous. Smiles said it was infused with rosemary and garlic. We were starving so we inhaled it.\n\nOur food came and let me tell you, I ate more than I could handle. Simple because the meat was so sinful and the fries were perfection. Seriously, if I ever gave birth to a pile of french fries, these would be them. I've never loved fries as dearly as I loved these. I asked Smiles about the fries and he told us with a laugh \"it's actually a very complex french fry process\"!\n\nThe food came quick and the service was outstanding. Smiles seemed like a real charmer and not some hungry scenester who couldn't be bothered. He came over just enough to keep the drinks flowing, but not enough that he interrupted our conversation.\n\nWe found out that RHT uses as much local product as possible, which I appreciate. Local stimulates our economy and keeps our little communities afloat. I love local!\n\nThe receipt came on a postcard, which was thoughtful as the next day I passed it around work and told everyone how amazing the tavern was. We thanked Smiles and paid. We too were all Smiles when we walked out :) I had experienced a pretty lame day, but Russell House Tavern turned it all around. \n\nThank you to Big Love for such a nice date. I take back what I said about the \"just trust me\".\n\nEven if it means taking on the parking garages and urinating strangers... I think I will venture back to Harvard Square to visit my favorite little Cambridge Tavern.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:04:11Z","yelp_user_id":"7Qz8E_uzQrBlOKpoejyX5Q"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:31:42Z","date":"2012-07-08","review_id":"s1B8HR-LWoyAfe_0zxnkLQ","stars":4,"text":"Food was great and the service was good.

We had some clams (the green herb aioli and sweet pickle mignonette were superb), torched tuna from the raw bar, both very delicious.\n\nShared the short dirty Caesar and our entrees arrived. My husband had the grilled market fish, which was mahi mahi. This dish was made to perfection. Perfectly charred, came with a nice citrus salad that complemented the fish very well. I had the seared Gloucester cod loin, which came with very delicious creamed fennel and even more delicious roasted celery root, the bacony greens were too salty for me. The fish was covered with crunchy potato strings, which made the plate look very theatrical. \n\nWe shared a frozen orange bomb, which was so yummy. At this point we were stuffed to the brims.\n\nI need to single out our server Katie P in a good way. She was so attentive, nice and showed up right when we needed her. A+ service.

The bar staff is very knowledgeable and should be able to make any obscure cocktail that comes to mind. There is one bartender, specifically, that has just moved over from Drink and is great at helping to craft cocktails based on your flavor preferences.

Although it gets alot of visitors for its touristy location and although its a bit of a chaotic atmosphere, its fun, and the food/drink isn't compromised like that of its overpriced and underwhelming neighbor, John Harvard's.  The beer and spirit menu is vast and carefully selected, the menu has a perfect amount of offerings that cater to more sophisticated pub palettes but still has a few traditional menu items for folks that can't swallow the oysters or charchuterie.  Its got an equal parts-mix of groups of Harvard grad student-drinkers, date-night folk, and out-of-town diners that have exhausted a day in the Square. The bartenders that know how to mix a great drink and know their liquor, and and the dishes are well presented, hearty(but not huge) , which is good for those of us counting our calories after that 12% Otter Creek draught.  I highly recommend all of the items I've consumed in my visits- the crab cakes, caesar salad, salt & pepper shrimp, and my friend loves the oysters.

Not necessarily because it's terrible all around but because this pub has so much potential and yet, still manages to suck.\n\nStarting with the positive: (most) of the food was delicious. I went with two friends, and we ordered an assortment of dishes (the menu has since varied slightly but it involved a beef dish, some scallops, a pizza and pork belly) and everything (except the pork belly) was fantastically seasoned and prepared. The pork belly was just a block of fat. Now, I know that pork belly has a lot of fat -- that's what makes the meat so delicious. But there was no meat in this dish, which seems unacceptable. Since the rest of the meal was so good, I'm chocking that up to a mistake in the kitchen. Either way, we tried to mention this issue to the waitress but encountered some difficulties. See below.\n\nThe negatives start and end with the service. But man, the service was really neglectful. We were seated on time and our drink order was taken by a seemingly friendly waitress. We ordered a bottle of wine and she promptly brought us three dirty glasses. We mentioned this to her and asked for bread. 10 minutes later she returns with glasses. Still no bread. We asked again and she said she'd bring it right away and she took our order. 20 minutes later she brings our food. STILL NO BREAD. Oh well, on to meal time. The waitress came by our table exactly once to ask how the food was and was nowhere to be found when we wanted to complain about the pork belly. She returned long after our plates were clean and asked if we wanted dessert.\n\nI should say that the waitress wasn't bad, per se, at what she was doing. She had just been instructed to follow a very strict script: seat customers, take drink order, take food order and ask exactly once how it is. I understand that the place is busy but if the waitress is nowhere to be found for an entire meal, I think the restaurant is too busy.

Even the greens on top were more than decoration - they were yummy!\nI tried the Champs Elysees, Battle of Trafalgar, and a cocktail called the Crimson Crow I believe? (three drinks, guess I forgot.) They were all delicious and different, but my favorite was the Battle of Trafalgar, which was made with Pimm's but tasted like honey wine.\nThe bartender was very patient with our group of five who kept ordering different elaborate cocktails for three hours. \nThis is a great place to go with friends for after-work drinks and appetizers.

We didn't bother after our experience with their staff in trying to set up.\n\nWe were planning to have a nice dinner with out of town guests the night before our wedding. It was meant to be a nice meal where our families could meet and we could spend a little more time with guests who traveled far (and some from abroad) to celebrate with us.\n\nWe very rashly decided on Russell House because of its location and feel just as the invitations were going out the door. BIG MISTAKE. Neither of us had eaten there and we hadn't experienced the service. Now we know better.\n\nWe signed a contract with Russell House to do a private dinner. The woman who is supposed to be their events coordinator would not respond to our emails or calls. Two weeks before our dinner when we were trying to adjust the head count and settle on a pre fixed menu, it took 5 days for the events coordinator to return our calls and emails. At that point she promised us a draft of the pre fixed menu, which we didn't see until calling her multiple times a few days later. \n\nThe minimum we had to reach was so high that with a 4 course meal and raw bar at the table to \"nibble on,\" as they told us, we still weren't getting anywhere near the minimum. They refused to include the tax, administrative fee (whatever that is), and gratuity in the minimum and gave me attitude when I told them it was ridiculous that we couldn't even get close to the minimum with all of this food. Who on earth can even eat that much?!\n\nWe cut our loses, decided that it was entirely worth losing the $250 deposit (although because of their complete lack of responsiveness in this process, I firmly believe that they should be reimbursing us for our pain and suffering), I WILL NEVER, EVER GO BACK TO RUSSELL HOUSE TAVERN.\n\nWe had a fantastic meal at the Foundry on Elm, who was nice enough to accommodate us at the last minute with a large party on a Friday night. The food was excellent, the service superb (they had at least 3 servers working our table for the full evening, including one of the managers), and it was HALF THE PRICE (even when you factor in the deposit we had to eat). \n\nWe are very loyal restaurant goers in the Cambridge and Somerville area and all I have to say is WOW. Never again.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:17:31Z","yelp_user_id":"p1hrZ1O8hCMNyaLapPi9_Q"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:05:12Z","date":"2011-07-28","review_id":"ugqdbPBloa0_s0ibxq043Q","stars":4,"text":"fun place to visit.

Given the timing, I'm ready to forgive peccadilloes.\n\nTheir menu was pretty flexible, but not too crazy.  There are \"small plates,\" appetizers (which are larger than the small plates), a raw bar, a small charcuterie selection, a few pizzas, entrees, and sides a la carte.  About 8-10 options in each of the small plates, appetizers, and entrees, with some overlap between small plates and appetizers.\n\nThe overall approach of the chef is to focus on seasonal, local ingredients.  This wasn't immediately obvious from the menu; the only very seasonal thing I saw were ramps.  But hey... my palate isn't so refined as to be able to distinguish local red onions from AGAR red onions.  \n\nI had an appetizer-sized Caesar salad, and a trio of pork (pork belly, pork loin, and pork shoulder, drizzled with a sweet vinegar sauce) that usually comes with grits but I subbed out for mushroom gratin, and a bit of a mizuna salad.  (Mizuna tastes like a slightly spicy arugula.)  \n\nThe Caesar salad was perfect.  Anchovies were available, so I indulged.  The lettuce was crisp and uniformly cut into bite sized pieces.  (I don't know why this is so hard for some restaurants to do, but it doesn't happen as much as it should.)  The salad was perfectly dressed, and the dressing itself had an excellent balance of lemon, pepper, and rich salinity.  A nice touch they do is to add a bit of rough-cut parsley in their Caesar salad.  It's enough of a finesse to make it interesting, without going so far as to be trying too hard.\n\nThe appetizer-sized salad was pretty big, so I ended up splitting it with my wife.\n\nThe entree was a nice size.  Probably about 6-8 oz. of pork all told.  Each cut was cooked perfectly:  the loin was moist, the shoulder was tender and smoky, and the belly melted in my mouth without being gristly or chewy.   Really, no room for improvement here.\n\nThe mizuna salad included some red onions and was dressed with a simple vinaigrette.  Its brightness made a nice contrast to the rich pork dishes.\n\nThere was a little mix-up with the mushroom gratin.  The waitress mentioned it included fontina cheese, but it came out as simply mushrooms cooked in olive oil topped with bread crumbs.  It was tasty, to be sure, but not what I was expecting.  I'm sure these kinks will be worked out in time though.\n\nDuring the meal, someone brought over a small complimentary dish of smoked almonds (which go for $5 as a small plate).  They were tasty, if you like smoked things.  (I do).  Better yet, they were served warm.  Perfect for the rainy day we were having.\n\nLike its predecessor Z-Square, the restaurant occupies two levels.  Although I'm sure there were renovations, the decor is generally the same both upstairs and downstairs.   (I might be wrong on this... my recollection of Z-Square is somewhat sketchy.)  Notably, the \"lunch counter\" upstairs was replaced by a bar... a step in the right direction.\n\nThe service was reasonably attentive.  Our waitress wasn't able to answer all our questions right away, but she was very quick to ask the kitchen and come back.   One nice thing they do is to leave each table with a large bottle of \"house-filtered\" water, rather than trying to keep refilling each glass from a pitcher.  I'm sure this will streamline service when it gets busy.\n\nAll in all, a solid debut.  I'll keep coming back for as long as they keep this level of quality up.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:12:26Z","yelp_user_id":"DqJSC80cGoR-4zdFpJHJFQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:11:37Z","date":"2011-01-01","review_id":"uhGEa3GJXhdKALdJSvr9wg","stars":4,"text":"I have been here twice, and each time I was impressed.

Just there for drinks, we bellied up to the bar and asked the gentleman behind the counter if he had a recommendation for a spicy cocktail.  \"Tabasco spicy or ginger spicy?\" the man replied.

I maintain that they're one of the most polarizing foods out there - there's no middle ground, either you love these things or you hate them.

Now, if you're not a regular at Russell House, you may not have realized that there is a downstairs, and if so, you'd really be missing out.  The ground floor seating area and bar is generally crowded and noisy, so I always walk straight downstairs, where the atmosphere is more refined and more intimate, with its leather booths, ambient lighting, dark woods, and vintage photographs.  Some of my most memorable nights out in Boston have been at Russell House - sitting downstairs in the leather booths, drinking wine, and having deep conversations with close friends all night long.  I could spend hours upon hours here.\n\nIt's obvious that I adore this place, but I must admit that I've never been blown away by anything on the menu.  Everything I've had (including the roasted giannone farm chicken, the pt. judith bluefish, the jonah crab cakes, and the melted cambozola cheese appetizer, among other things) has been good - even great - but nothing has ever been extraordinary.  However, their extensive wine, beer, and cocktail menu alone is worth coming here.

The gesture of removing the charge for that sandwich from the bill was meaningless, as any rational person would expect that as a minimum, and also because by that point we were so angry and disgusted my girlfriend had no appetite.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:21:16Z","yelp_user_id":"fJygv1N1hDjDlrk2I03BpA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:23:32Z","date":"2012-04-06","review_id":"WAWZp4l_Elniz8FwsBUwRQ","stars":4,"text":"First impression of RHT: Casually elegant.

Which was weird, because I requested to sit outside. We were seated in a corner table. Same glasses with etch marks - one would think since I specifically mentioned this incident in my prior review they might have tried to avoid this, but they did not. My boyfriend and I both shrugged to one another and decided then that we should maybe count this place out.\n\nAnd then comes our waiter. He was a lot of personality. At first, I was wairy, he was a little much to take in. I thought maybe he was trying too hard since I had previously commented on the service, but later decided that was his personality. I ended up loving our waiter, he was super attentive, informative without being condescending, and made us laugh.\n\nOne thing I noticed which was odd, people who I assume were hostesses and managers would kind of just slowly saunter around the dining room, some of them looking at us awkwardly. One woman who I assume was an assistant manager actually pointed at us and asked the hostess who we were. It made us feel really awkward. The General Manager came over to us and explained that he had a table opening up outside, but we decided to stay at the table we were seated at. Wish we had known prior to being sat at the table downstairs. He was a nice guy - asked us a few different times how things were and if we needed anything.\n\nAs far as the food and drink goes - I started with the City of Eternal Spring, which was light, sweet and bitter all at the same time. It was perfect. They really know how to make their cocktails here.\n\nWe got 4 oysters to start, followed by their steak tartare. It was savory, and melted in your mouth. My only comment is they only give two of the grilled pieces of brioche, but about a half cup of tartare, and could use at least four, if not six. We also ordered the Fiore Di Nonna Burrata, which was accompanied with purple shiso, house cured lonza, pickled raisins. The dish was so well balanced, and the presentation was great. We ordered four more oysters, which were perfect. I have never been disappointed with their raw bar.\n\nFor our entries, I ordered the steak frites again, since it was so perfect the prior time. I was a bit let down. I asked for the steak medium rare, but it was super rare, on the side of being blue. I ate what I could of it, but ended up leaving about 3 ounces of it for my boyfriend to eat because it was so rare. Fries were crispy and well seasoned, and their garlic aioli is awesome - savory and yet not too overpowering with the garlic. My boyfriend got the pork trio, and he was pleased. His cheesy grits were outstanding. I hate grits, but I loved these, they were creamy and salty and the perfect compliment for the dish. I could eat a bowl of just those grits.\n\nWe got the chocolate mouse cake with strawberry rhubarb compote and a chocolate ganache poured over the top. This was delicious, and satisfied my sweet tooth.\n\nThey were generous when it came to the bill, which was nice. Would I come back again? Maybe, I was impressed by a few things, and disappointed by a few as well. A list of about fifteen other places I want to try before coming back awaits.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:56:18Z","yelp_user_id":"0iiv07O5kcpoah60r6SIKg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:02:39Z","date":"2012-09-18","review_id":"wfD6MQNZ7SbktpBrL4FcYg","stars":4,"text":"Came here for a late (1 PM) lunch with friends while visiting the east coast. \n\nFriendly service: we were seated quickly and had a great waitress who was knowledgeable about the menu and happy to answer any questions we had.

And as a side note to the reviewers who call the food uninspired, the head and sous chef from Upstairs on The Square frequent this classic and flavorful spot -- a testament to the unique, Europe-esque cuisine found at Russell House Tavern.  \n\nI am constantly wishing there was a place in Cambridge where I felt comfortable trying anything on the menu, something like a Franklin Cafe but without the hassle of driving to Boston's empirical South End.  Tonight I had a special dinner here, sat by the window on a cool summer evening, and enjoyed literally every bite of food I tasted.  We started with a Torched Tuna -- a delicious, sashimi grade plate of tuna with basil, olive oil and generous flavors that was gone within seconds.  We were so impressed with the tuna we chose to almost double our order, having a Short Dirty Caesar with spicy anchovy croutons: a dish I would describe as flavorful but not heavy -- a terrific second course.\n\nFor Entrees, we enjoyed a Hearth Baked Pasta and Steak Frites, my personal favorite.  The pasta again combined a medley of flavors without being too heavy, but the real award winner was the side sauce served with the Frites -- a Garlic Aioli that was decadent and unmatched as a Frite dipping sauce.  I asked our waiter for the recipe.  We paired these entree's with a Mushroom Gratin side; simply unique and flavorful.  \n\nAlthough the food was above my expectations for a restaurant that took over the uninspired Z-Square Cafe, the real show stealer was our waiter, Peter H.  Peter was calm, confident, and well informed about every item on the menu.  His demeanor and professionalism echoed that of the restaurant itself.  \n\nSimply put, Cambridge is generally peddling shit as classy food.  Tory Row, Grafton Street, Om, Upstairs on the Square; all these places are charging Boston prices for suburban food.  They are ok places if the prices were more reasonable but generally nothing above your average higher-end chain spot.  Cambridge is not Boston and the restaurants solidify this dichotomy.  \n\nRussell is a great place to relax, enjoy a mindfully created meal and world-class service.  Until Franklin Cafe relocates to Cambridge (hopefully in place of some uninspired, overpriced generic spot) I will frequent the RHT for a meal that opens my mind to new flavors at an appropriate price.  I hope they are here to stay.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:26:28Z","yelp_user_id":"G6lbmLUEFrboZg9GcRH0Ng"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T15:58:34Z","date":"2012-03-31","review_id":"YNVeLAO7UgXFTYdMfbuL2g","stars":1,"text":"My daughter and I went here today for brunch.

As luck would have it, my dear Queens Community Manager, Leighann, had filled the role of Boston Community Manager in the past.  So one afternoon while we and a group of other Yelpers lunched on dosas in the canteen of a Hindu temple in Flushing, I asked her to recommend a restaurant where four people could go for a nice dinner in Boston that's not going to poke a hole in our wallets.  Russell House Tavern, she said.  Ok, Russell House Tavern it was to be.\n\nRussell House Tavern is located in Harvard Square, which was perfect for us because my friends had wanted to visit Harvard.  So we spent a couple of hours touring the neighbourhood and arrived at the restaurant for our 9pm reservation.  We made our way downstairs and were led to a table for four that was ready for us.  A Celtics play-off game was on TV so guys at the bar were watching and talking about the game over beer, getting excited whenever someone scored.  Together with the classy decor and low lighting, it created such a warm and friendly environment that at the same time felt upscale.  \n\nA quick glance over the entrees on the menu and the Ozark Heritage Pork Trio immediately popped out at me.  Grilled loin?  Yes.  Confit belly?  Yes!  Smoked shoulder!  YES!  For an appetiser I decided on the Jonah Crab Cakes, which consisted of sweet pickle tartar, candy beet, and apple salad.  And I also ordered a Peak Organic Nut Brown Ale for refreshment.  \n\nThe crab cakes were soft and tasty, and the beer was delicious as well.  But I was truly impressed with the Ozark Heritage Pork Trio.  When I bit into the pork shoulder for the first time, I thought to myself: holy shit are you shitting me?  I mean, this was awesomely delicious.  It was so very tender and juicy, like it had been cooking in a slow cooker all day.  And the flavours were so full, savoury, and satisfying.  Seriously, I couldn't get enough.  I probably could have ordered a second plate.  \n\nI am definitely going back to Russell House Tavern the next time I am in Cambridge, and I can't thank Leighann enough for the recommendation.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:06:32Z","yelp_user_id":"qYQXUsBXW0nvkl9rzV9U8w"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:52:06Z","date":"2010-05-15","review_id":"yQ6XZUHFvAV6yl12uFo-wg","stars":3,"text":"I would have given Russell House Tavern four stars but for the service.  Let me begin with a list of what was bad and then I'll get into what's pretty good.\n\n--I inquired about availability while waiting to meet a friend.  The hostess was very snooty about not having a reservation.  She suggested we could try downstairs, and the extremely clear unspoken message was \"as that is where the worthless plebians eat.\"\n\n--When my friend arrived 30 minutes later, all the tables that were empty when I first went in were still empty.  I *do* believe that they had reservations, but they obviously are having severe growing pains about how to allocate them.  There were roughly 15 spots in the upstairs section sitting empty in the 30 minute span of time I was waiting and other non-reservation people were coming in and inquiring.\n\n--Neither the hostess upstairs nor downstairs suggested we could eat at the bar instead of waiting, which I thought was odd.\n\n--Our waitress was pathetically amateurish at upselling.  She tried to tell me the small plates \"Little Local Salad\" was tiny and not enough to share.  When it arrived, it was *clearly* plenty for one (not on its own of course, but as part of the whole meal) and perfect for sharing amongst other small plates.  \n\n--Our waitress was AGRESSIVELY trying to turn and burn us.  She tried to clear our plates, I am not kidding, *eight times* before we were actually done.  We stayed for two hours but it was annoying to have to fight off the waitress every fifteen minutes.  \n\n--Along the turn-and-burn lines, all of what we ordered arrived at once.  Granted, we ordered some random things, but I don't think it's my job to set the pace of how orders come out.  \n\nThe generally unpleasant and uncaring service was a real downfall for me.  The total cost of our meal before tip was $45/person, which is no small chunk of change.  For god's sake people, if you want to promote yourself as an upscale gastropub where people spend money, then let them linger and enjoy themselves.  \n\n\nOK, now here's what's good.  Despite the shittay service, the atmosphere is fantastic.  We did sit downstairs and even though it wasn't as breezy as upstairs, it was extremely welcoming and cozy.  It's easy to relax and wile away the hours here (well, theoretically).\n\nThe drinks are out of this world.  First we split a pitcher of the St. Germain cocktail, which was splendid.  I could have drank that for the rest of my life.  However, I would not recommend getting the pitcher, despite it's refreshingness.  It seems like a good deal, but if you're looking to actually get intoxicated, it's a better deal to order one cocktail at a time.  I suspect the St. Germain pitcher has a lot more soda water and ice than wonderful booze.\n\nFor \"dessert,\" I had the Champs Elysee (sorry if spelling is off...I thought their drinks menu would be online but it's not) and my friend had the Moscow Mule.  Shazam!  Those bitches were strong and tasted fantastic.  \n\nThe menu is quite eclectic and fun.  There's a raw bar, appetizers, small plates, pizzas and fancypants entrees.  We had a hodgepodge of things:\n\n--1. Two oysters apiece\n--2. The aforementioned Little Local Leaf Salad\n--2a. The small plates Jonah crab cake\n--3. The butcher's choice pizza\n\n...and that is the order in which those things would have come out if I'd had my druthers/been the waitress.  But I digress.  The point is, there is an assortment of options here for sharing, indulging, and just plain enjoying.  The oysters were fresh and their accompanying sauces were perfectly piquant.  The \"little\" salad was very refreshing with just the right balance of flavors between the figs, walnut and mustard.  The crab cake on its own was too salty but eaten with the greens and sauce (which is surely how its intended) its great.  The butcher's choice pizza also walked the line of being almost too salty, but juuuust managed to keep it light and tasty.\n\nSo...I don't know.  The food and atmosphere is wonderful and the restaurant fills a long empty niche in Harvard Square (both in terms of the defunct Z-Square and the need for some upscale casual dining).  But the attitude of the service is just bad and pretty off-putting, as well as their incompetence at managing reservations.  I guess I would recommend always having a reservation if you go here, and if you are ordering small items to share, order them one or two at a time to counter the server's attempt to turn and burn you.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:05:10Z","yelp_user_id":"_vvfn7829XzLc8_l9ne2HA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:42:29Z","date":"2010-08-02","review_id":"ySreBoz3oOKwyQYnML8xjQ","stars":4,"text":"So I went here for lunch to see if I liked it.

Thoughtful and unusual beer list. Appealing French gastropub decor (though becoming commonplace in Boston).\n\nDetails:\n\nThe bar: It gets crowded, but if you can find a seat (or a patch of floor to stand on), Russell House is a good place to drink beer. The bartenders know the beers on draft well and can make educated recommendations. They have Left Hand Milk Stout on draft, and were offering a \"pre-mixed black and tan\" beer called Shabbadoo by BBC last time we were here that I thought was pretty awesome.\n\nThe restaurant: You know how I described the Shabbadoo as \"awesome\"? That's because it was one of only a few adjectives our server knew. Don't get me wrong, he was a good waiter, but as one of my friends pointed out: It would be helpful to get a better description of a dish than \"awesome\" or \"really good.\" He wasn't really able to provide vivid descriptions of tastes or textures to help us decide on a choice (though we did opt against the burger when he was unable to christen it \"awesome\"). Aside from the awesome issue, service was excellent.\n\nSo what did we order? As one friend put it, \"the menu.\" We shared several plates to start:\n\n-Deep fried poached egg. This was pretty cool. I don't really like egg yolks but was willing to give this a try. There wasn't much yolk in my portion, but damn was this delicious (and weird). This was texturally confusing in a good way, like something you'd see on Top Chef. \n\n-Bone marrow. Meh. It needed salt, in my opinion. I loved the little toast squares it was served with, though.\n\n-Pig head. Nommin'. I liked this pig head dish better than the one at Coppa; it was topped with yet another egg and sat in a puddle of a delicious sweet sauce.\n\n-Fried oysters (on special). Another meh. It was supposedly served with a \"slab\" of bacon, but this amounted to about half a strip. Oysters have such a delicate flavor that I think they're wasted on frying. \n\n-Short rib Wellington. Served in a ramekin, and looks more like a pot pie. Tasty, but weird to share among the table. Probably the least memorable dish we had.\n\n-Liverwurst (the \"special pate\"). I'm not a huge liverwurst fan, but this was pretty good. It didn't have that overwhelming coppery taste liver sometimes can. The liverwurst lovers among us gave this a thumbs up.\n\nFor an entree, I had the roast chicken. It was nothing special, though I would have licked those mashed potatoes off the plate if I'd been alone. Of the other entrees our table ordered, the winner seemed to be the pork trio, which featured three distinct pork dishes. \n\nThe dessert menu looked awesome, but I didn't want to strain the integrity of my intestines any further. I had to say no.\n\nNext time I come to Russell House, I'd like to try a different set of items to explore the other menu options. I'll probably get the egg and/or the pig head again since those are the two dishes that keep coming back to me in delicious daydreams.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:25:10Z","yelp_user_id":"e8ctA42_X95wLlrf09YZQg"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:23:00Z","date":"2010-09-10","review_id":"yx1dDnGpmD91Bk6a3chAKA","stars":4,"text":"The folks at cardullo's told me that this place was superb and i was anxious already to give it a try, so my friend and i had dinner here.

The upstairs looks like a great place to hang out with friends or colleagues after work. and they have a great beer list, wine list, and cocktail offering.\n\nI made my reservation on Open Table, but considering it was midweek I probably didn't have to. The staff were very friendly, sometimes bordering on theatrical though. They may have been overly trained to avoid the usual Boston-speak and cater to the intellectual crowd, but that's totally my assumption.\n\nWe got the steak tar tar (really good, definitely needs the crostinis to bring out the flavors), the burger, the chicken (the one with carrots and mash) and the softshell crab (was the fish market special for that day).

The burger went down well, though the bacon wasn't omitted as requested, maybe upon better judgment, and the chicken was much enjoyed by my boyfriend (and dog) when I finally got home that evening.\n\nI would definitely dine here again. Love the atmosphere, really excited about the menu. Love that it's a lot of local ingredients and daring. AND very affordable.\n\nUPDATE\n6/14/10\nI tried to hold off on this update, hoping the situation would be resolved quickly. When my friend and I had dinner I gave her $100 cash towards the bill (which was about $100). She gave the waitress $80 and asked her to put the rest on her card, where she would leave the tip. She failed to notice until the next day that she had been charged the full bill on her card, so the waitress pocketed the cash. Granted, she did sign the receipt, but an $80 tip on a $96 bill? Who assumes that? We don't even look like ballers. Anyways, she did call the restaurant and they told her they would refund her the overpaid amount. Today the charge went through and they charged her the full amount. She will be calling again tomorrow. Hopefully it was just a timing thing and it will be resolved ASAP. Removing a couple stars while I wait...\n\nWoot! All resolved! The manager (I think it was the manager) called my friend to make sure everything went through (took a while to get updated in the banking system.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:18:52Z","yelp_user_id":"9S_9h0JGlmEjWkvN4QhmBQ"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:11:46Z","date":"2012-06-04","review_id":"zA5vMYz2CspBgd7RssSp2Q","stars":4,"text":"Got a great window seat, had the hamburger, and my husband had the pork sandwich.

I've been feeling particularly disappointed by options in Harvard Square these days, and so on our way home we decided - hey - it's about time.  Some sweet parking karma aided us in our hunger adventure, and in we went.\n\nThe atmosphere is fine - it feels slightly schizo, reminding me a little of Neptune Oyster, but also an old Italian place, but then again a Tavern-type (i assume this is the goal hence the name) via some of the seating.  Our hostess attempted to sit us at one of the small two person tables squished in between a bunch of other folks, but I asked for seats at the near-empty tall tables instead.  She was quite accommodating - good choice for privacy, maybe not so much for comfort as the stools have no backs and rock either side to side or back and forth depending on how it's situated (not just mine - my boyfriend's did too).\n\nI was surprised to find there actually wasn't a ton on the menu I was excited to order - maybe this is cause of the prices...I'll get to that.\n\nI was particularly intrigued by the Crispy Soft Poached Chip in Farm Egg, so I ordered that and the Roasted Chicken.  The first time our waitress came to take our order I wasn't quite ready, though my boyfriend had decided on the RIbeye from the moment he picked up the menu - love at first sight.  The second time round I was ready and placed my order.  My boyfriend ordered his steak, only to be told they didn't have it tonight and he should try the steak frites instead.  I'm sorry, but I feel like this is one of the biggest mistakes servers/restaurants make these days, ESPECIALLY when your prices are this high.  WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US WHEN WE ARRIVED??  Sorry for the caps, this just really frustrates me.  Also, it's the most expensive thing on your menu - why wouldn't you tell us.  And you're suggesting the steak frites instead of a Rib Eye?  I'm sorry, that's just sacrilegious.  Whatever, he ordered the pork trio (which I had actually been excited about anyways).\n\nAn aside - our waitress turned out to be super duper spacey.  The food came out really slowly, and instead of playing it off tactfully, she came over, kind of stared at our empty table blankly, looked at us and was like, \"Oh, um, that's weird - I'll check with the kitchen I'm sure your food is coming right out.\"   Something to keep in mind is that the restaurant was not very busy at this time.   A few minutes later our food came.  Our waitress came over about 30 seconds later and started to ask how it was, but instead said, \"Oh, you just got it didn't you?\"  She looked sheepish and walked away.  Then she came back a few minutes later, briefly didn't remember why she was there, and said, \"Okay, so how is it now?\"  The whole thing was just weird, and mildly uncomfortable.\n\nBut, lets get down to business. \n-There was no bread basket.  If your appetizers are all basically $9 and up, your small plates are tiny and around the same price range, and it takes longer than is normal for food to hit the table...sorry, but you should have a bread basket.\n-The egg was good.  Didn't blow my mind, but it was worth ordering.  Maybe not worth it's price since it's not super shareable, but whatever.  Also, if many of the other small plates are really that small, don't bother.\n-The chicken was dry.  Like, really dry.  Like, I had made better chicken at my house a few days earlier (not kidding).  The potatoes were also dry.  The carrots were...gross.  I left much of each part of my meal on the plate.\n-The grits that came under the pork trio were really good, though there was probably an 1/8 of a cup total on the plate, spread out, and covered in salad.  \n-The pork belly tasted like spare ribs with no flavor (see Citizen Public House for some pork belly that'll knock your socks off with flavor).  The smoked pork tasted like...smoked pork - points there I guess.  The pork loin was crazy dry.\n\nSo, RHT, you make me sad - I really really REALLY wanted to like you, but in the end you made Tory Row (which I wasn't a huge fan of in the first place) the better option for the square.  \n\nIf you're trying to be what I think you're trying to be, either make better food, or lower your prices.  Or, better yet, both!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:41:39Z","yelp_user_id":"CpB00022d3I7EhxaM9lNhA"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:41:18Z","date":"2012-08-21","review_id":"ZdyezSlznyvgypYaqGJzsA","stars":5,"text":"Love this place.

It comes with cherry gelee, which is exciting because I feel like Marcel from Top Chef would have made it. All in all, a delicious little dish, creamy and salty in all of the right ways (okay, gay boys... stop snickering... even I can't deny that sentence sounds really inappropriate).\n\nFor entrees, I got The Andria flatbread pizza, a delicious little pizza with lots of cheese, sweet garlic and figs. Figs. Garlic. Perfect. So good. My date tried the White Clam flatbread, which smelled delightful. I didn't quite try it as I didn't want to go into anaphylactic shock, but it apparently tastes great. We'll take his word for it.\n\nThe beer list runs pretty deep. It also includes one of my favorites, Left Hand Milk Stout. We were certainly happy with the options of beer. Our server, while clearly swamped, was still kind enough to talk to us about her favorite beers and what she likes to drink them with...\n\nThe place was super packed. It was a Wednesday night at the peak of dinner time. We didn't have to wait for a seat, but the line probably started as soon as we were seated.\n\nAll in all, a good experience.

We first walked in and had to mill around quite a bit before we were taken care of in any way.  We then sat at one of the big high top tables, which was fine by me.  It took some more time waiting for a server to appear.  I ended up going with her suggestion of a \"seasonal\" drink with the Wigglesworth.  The cocktail was pretty great, seriously boozy with a smooth finish, and I liked the little glass it was served in.  My companion got a beer from their decent list of draughts on tap.  We did not indulge in wine on tap, but I am happy to see that the selection is a very local vineyard.  On to the food...  My burger was cooked perfectly but it is served with a giant pickle spear draped across the top which is seriously unappetizing for a girl with a pickle aversion.  I understand many establishments add pickle to their sandwich plates but when it is not listed in the description I really don't think it should end up dripping disgustingness all over my main course.  It came with a huge pile of pretty sub-par fries.  They seemed overdone and a little cold as well as under-salted.  My companion got the chicken waldorf sandwish and said it was \"just OK\" with slightly messy sandwich prep.  \n\nThe decor in here is decent, and the downstair is definitely more appealing.  THe bar seats look nice and comfy and at any subsequent visit I know where I'll be headed for a seat.  It is hard to go into this place without comparing it to the other fairly new wood ceilinged gastro-pub The Gallows and in each and every category, decor, ambience, service, drinks and food The Gallows takes the cake.\n\nI hope i return and am impressed in the future because this is a solid 3.5 stars but I believe they can do better.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:25:49Z","yelp_user_id":"BdxRaSIBh6P5HRK0_w8X3Q"},{"business_id":"_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:15:47Z","date":"2010-10-03","review_id":"zmPA3LyeFKpYjhbQBHfpiA","stars":5,"text":"My bf and I were wandering around Harvard Square looking for a brunch spot and stumbled upon the Russell House Tavern.

On a recent trip back in search of gainful employment (in the form of a university sponsored job fair) I was implored to try Fiesta Cafe.

I ordered tamales and was greeted with rubbery and unpleasant masa wrapped around a minimal amount of chicken. The sour cream did indeed come in a school lunch single serving container as mentioned in another review, and the rice and beans were sorely lacking in positive qualities. \n\nI gave two stars, however, because the service was good and they carried tamarind Jarritos.

Thayer is an ice rink but the ice was gone leaving a court clear for the skaters to compete in. It was wild! Spectators were seated close to the ring and outside in the seats. Watching in Thayer afforded better seating because of the bleachers. The crowd was entertained by a DJ but Girl Haggard played as well! It was an excellent night. \nI had to leave early unfortunately, the big man can't last for very long. \nI always think of that movie from the 70's, \"Rollerball\" and think of cheesy theatrics and major pain when I think of Roller Derby. This is not at all like what I was expecting when I first went. Families, couples old and young and kids too, enjoyed the bouts, the music and the fun.

So why am I not a derby girl? I can't skate to save my life. So I watch instead.\n\nThe first bout I ever went to was after my college graduation, and to be honest I totally fell asleep. I had been up for hours, so it was completely justified. Next, a group of friends went to see another friend (she plays for the Cosmonaughties/Boston Derby Dames league). It was a ton of fun. It was easy to understand and really fun to watch. Then I moved to Providence and decided to check out PRD.\n\nMy first reaction was that the venue, and crowd, was much smaller than the BDD venue/crowd. It's probably understandable, but it bothered me that roller derby didn't seem to have as big of a following in Providence as it did in Boston. So I was hesitant at first. But then the bout started, and these girls are just as tough as I'd hoped.\n\nAdmittedly, I've only been to two PRD bouts, but have every intention of attending as many as I can for next season.

We got home and put the batteries into the helicopters and tried relentlessly to get the helicopter to lift off the ground, but couldn't so my husband decided it was best to return the item.\n\nWe end up going tonight to return the product and was told, \"the item is not returnable,\" Our reaction.. \"What?\" The sales person states, \"We can't resell it,\" we told him, \"Well it isn't something that should be sold as the item is broken and can not be used anyways.\"  He then shows us the policy and we ask, \"Where does it state on the receipt that it is not returnable?\" He could not show us exactly and I was able to read that \"Some Items can not be returned.\" So we moaned and groan about the policy and the fact that we could not see information that the item is returnable.\n\nThe gentleman excuses himself after my husband asked for their corporate office number. He leaves the floor for a good 3 minutes during that time I'm looking over the policy to see where exactly it states it is not returnable.  After a while he comes out and says, \"I called my manager, and she doesn't want to give you corporate's number, and I'm just doing my job but I'll just return your money.\" \n\nMoney back in our pockets.\n\nThis evening we decided to call Brookstone's Customer Service line and ask about the return policy and ask if this was an item that is a returnable item and why the store would say it wasn't.  Well the customer service stated, \"Yes it is returnable, and one of the reasons why the store could have said it was not returnable is cause they didn't want to take the hit.\" So my husband replies back, \"What their sales are more important than the customer's satisfaction.  The person on the other line went quiet, but in a way stated, 'yep' that is about it. \n\nMoral of the story, Brookstone at the Stanford Shopping Center is not a place to go to for your electronic gizmos.

The music that caught my interest led me around the corner to find a group (This is true btw) of 8 people with fiddles legit playing irish music. Age range from 10-65 in the group. They were amazing! I don't know what the hell was going on but the ambiance was great!\n\nMove into the next room and find an open bar and plenty of seating for the large group I'm with. We order our beverages from a nice woman with an irish lilt in her voice.\n\nThe reason this place gets 5 stars instead of 4 is (everything after this sentence is alleged and may or may not of happened, feel free to message me if you're the manager to edit it out)\nThey went above and beyond! It was a Sunday night, and eventually our group of 12 dwindled to 3. We realized we had no beer for the hotel, every place we went stopped serving growlers after 6pm. Shmoozed a bit with the staff and was able to come out with a trashbag of beers (at the higher price of course around 3 bucks a can) but desperate times call for desperate measures! And so accommodating of them to help me out on my friends birthday.\n\nI bet if I needed someone killed I could come here and get the full service for that too!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:09:31Z","yelp_user_id":"lAlQ2x_AfgBlQuwlgyCrlA"},{"business_id":"_BG8WroxU2JbZSij6VWx_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T16:55:40Z","date":"2012-06-25","review_id":"DaY-G7Gkn-hhWZt3sEJmEg","stars":4,"text":"Thank you Providence Yelpers for suggesting RiRa for a group event I ran tonight.

When I first walked in the place had a nice vibe to it. It was dark, wood tables, hell even a dart board. I didn't like how dispersed the place was. If I wasn't thinking twice I would think I was drinking in a warehouse. \n\nThey had a nice selection of beer. A large selection of Guinness fusion beers, so I order a Black and blue (Guinness and Blueberry Beer). It came out with a perfect head. So we started off on the right foot. \n\nThe food was probably the worst food I've had in Providence. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but this is Providence people. Only New York City has anything on us when it comes to food. My two friends order a personal margarita pizza and the blue burger with fries. I ordered the 2 1/2 apps, fried pickles and potato cakes. \n\nThe Margarita Pizza:\nI purchased better, much better, pizza from the freezer at my grocery store. It was as if they picked up a frozen pie and threw basil and tomato on it. It was luke warm too. The crust was the best part, but it was still a little too chewy for my tastes. (not warm doughy chewy, like dry soft chewy). Most damning of all my friend said \" I could do the same thing with an Ellio's pizza.\"\n\nThe Blue Burger:\nWas whatever. My friend said it was pretty dry and just came with blue cheese, no sauce no veggies. Kinda weird right? The fries needed a heavy hand of salt. I'm guessing it wasn't the worst, but not what you want to hear for a 10 dollar burger.\n\nFried Pickles:\nWhen done right they can be the best appetizer on the menu. These had potential, the batter used was solid and crispy. The dips (horseradish and spicy mayo) were on. It was just too thick of a cut on the pickle. They were so big by the time you bite into them the middle was cool. \n\nPotato Cake:\nCold disgusting gruel in pancake form. Not wasting my breath on it. \n\nOk Ri Ra, please stop calling yourself a pub and just say \"You know what I'm an Irish Themed dance club after 9 pm.\" I won't be back unless Ri Ra becomes a cool spot for 20 somethings.

At first impression, he was upfront and didn't beat around the bush.\n\nIn the end, my partner and I went in for a consultation, and we made out BIG!

Considering my rampant anxiety, the fact that I can say this shows something about the shop, its staff and professionalism. \n\nHaving wanted to get tattooed since 14 I figured my 19 year wait was proof that I really wanted to do this. I had been playing with an idea but I can't draw - that didn't help my anxiety. \n\nUsing the website I sent a general contact request where I provided basic info and a description of what I was thinking. A few days later I got a phone call from the shop, was asked a few questions and scheduled a consult. Based on what I wanted to have done, the shop set me up with Adam. \n\nOur consult was chill. I explained what I was thinking and provided a few pictures I'd printed that were kind of along the idea. We talked about a few different ideas, Adam said he would work on it and we scheduled a one o'clock appointment for today. \n\nFrom the consultation I knew NB was a good place for me. Adam was serious and knowledgable but also had a sense of humor and was chill about the whole thing. He was up front about the fact that what I had envisioned as design would not work with the size I wanted and took me through some options. \n\nToday I arrived at the shop after brunch with a few friends (and yes, brunch included a couple of mimosas to help with the nerves!) and was greeted by Jenn, another artist at the shop. I filled out some paperwork, and then Adam popped out to show me his concept: perfect!\n\nWe talked a little about color and then he finished setting up. He talked me through the process (I don't know if this was because my tough-guy act wasn't working or because he does it with everyone but it helped to know what he was doing) and then started. \n\nWe chit-chatted throughout and he was efficient and focused. He checked in at a few points toward the end and kind of kept me apprised of what he was doing.\n\nThe process was organized, chill and I liked that Adam checked in regularly if we had stopped chatting. I also liked that he told stories throughout, peppering the silence but not being too talkative. \n\nI will definitely return to Name Brand for another tattoo.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:04:01Z","yelp_user_id":"zP9HLd5nwdpHXhO2rKXjEw"},{"business_id":"_BZG5xpQX5CzO7fgFN4hfg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:42:19Z","date":"2009-10-05","review_id":"pJ0u76ly5FUU54RqtsWzcQ","stars":5,"text":"i've been getting a full sleeve at name brand, and they are among the best in the business. i'm in the industry myself, and have never worked with or for anyone there, and i can STILL highly recommend them. any of the artists at name brand would be the \"big dog\" at any other studio- there just happens to be like five of them. a large portion of their clientele is other tattoo artists and piercers- people who know. that should tell you something. not cheap but quality never is. they just moved to ground floor space on washington and the new shop is large, clean and comfortable. if you are in SE Michigan, you would be hard pressed to find a better place to get a tattoo.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:50:04Z","yelp_user_id":"WmA4pbbZWLe-2zBEiwIvHw"},{"business_id":"_BZG5xpQX5CzO7fgFN4hfg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:28:38Z","date":"2011-05-28","review_id":"PKSvHC9k1eL7Xomtphn1kA","stars":5,"text":"First tattoo, long story short:\n1\" X 5\" rib tattoo\nDone by Adam\nPut me completely at ease\nDid an amazing job\nVirtually no pain/maintenance required after \nWill definitely get all my future ink done here","updated_at":"2013-03-15T20:28:38Z","yelp_user_id":"AWewc9rMUlsKkJCr7rChOg"},{"business_id":"_BZG5xpQX5CzO7fgFN4hfg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:12:38Z","date":"2011-09-07","review_id":"q_RiGLppi67mt4zn09mXcQ","stars":2,"text":"I'm actually pretty happy with my tattoo.

I had initially been very wary of the first tattoo shop I'd walk into in a college town. Everyone there is professional, ultra-friendly, and, of course, a phenomenal artist.\n\nI received my favorite tattoo (Out of over 20) from Chad Hunt my second visit. I initially wanted a small traditional portrait of Chief Joseph, about the size of a CD. After emailing him I went in for my appointment and not only did he completely exceed my expectations, he had a drawing ready that left me absolutely awestruck. The experience was highly pleasant, to say the least--the studio is ultra comfortable, he was chatty and personable, and he worked quickly (My entire leg from the knee to the ankle tattooed in about 3.5 hours, with no quality sacrificed). It healed beautifully and I now have a stunning work of art on my leg that I am constantly complimented on--I wish it was somewhere on my body where I could show it off year-round!\n\nMy only regret is that I am moving soon and won't be able to get tattooed by the other artists there anytime in the near future, all of whom have brilliant (Brilliant being a total understatement) portfolios. A coworker of mine had a half-sleeve done by Jeff Zuck that actually made me gasp when I saw it. \n\nEven if you aren't a tattoo \"collector,\" I'd recommend Name Brand for your first/only tattoo.

I'm purely in it for the better-than-average dog food selection (it's not extensive, as the store is very tiny, just a few holistic brands that boast better ingredients than most brands you'll find at big-box pet stores) and it serves that purpose quite well. My only reason for not giving a 5th star is that now my dog is hooked on this particular kind of food & I can't find it at any mainstream pet store.\n\nMost natural brands of food will run $10-16 for a 5lb bag & the store clerk suggested that I try Fromm's brand, because of the good ingredient & it being a family-owned company based out of Wisconsin. She gave me a handful of single serving bags of different varieties to take home before I made my final selection. The 5lb bag is a mere $12 and you'll save about that amount of money by volume if you level up & buy the 33lb bag. She hooked me up with a frequent buyer card that they hang onto at the desk so I don't need to remember to bring it in.\n\nSure some of their non-food items are priced rather high but that's expected from any boutique store, which this clearly is. I stop in frequently just to browse and the owner & other employees have never been anything but jovial and informative. And sure they're not quick to jump when you walk in the door but the store is about the size of a large bedroom so it's not difficult to find a clerk if you've got a question.

When In my late teens, I had regular migraines that I at first thought were sinus headaches.  I later learned that many on my mother's side had them various points in their lives...thanks gene pool.  I tried a number of doctors, but most focused on their specialty alone.  A neurologist would say that I should be able to eat anything and not have headaches while a allergist-type wanted solely to look at the foods I ate.  Dr. Mathew provided the most balanced, comprehensive view.  He is a neurologist, but seems more multi-discipline.\n\nHe accurately diagnosed me and predicted the pattern of my headaches over the next 20 years or so.  They are now a non-issue except that I avoid a number of foods.  Over the course of those years, I have varied on taking some mild daily medication or none at all as needed.  He always looked for the basic solution first and has adjusted or eliminated medications gradually as new ones became available.  He was also the one of the first to be aware of the new triptan-based medications as they became available such as Imitrex (years ago), Relpax, etc.\n\nDr. Mathew is a reflective, quiet man that I have always found to be very kind and caring.  A person could misread him at first since he tends to use fewer words.  I've recommended him to my wife and my friends (mostly female) and every single one had glowing praise.  Most were long-term sufferers who had failed with other doctors.  My wife's were controlled quickly.  She no longer sees him and transitioned back to our primary care doctor for the now rare headache.\n\nSolving migraines and headaches can frankly be like detective work since there can be multiple triggers and complex interactions.  These include stress, food, hormone changes, lights, sound, weather, etc.  Dr. Mathew is like a detective, both in solving migraines and in his style.  He's a bit quiet and thoughtful, but happy to answer questions and explain the alternatives.\n\nOne earlier reviewer commented that Dr. Mathew should learn US culture and that women are allowed to ask questions here.  I'm sorry that person had a negative experience and side effects of a drug, but I can say that knowing Dr. Mathew that this comment does not represent him.  In fact, the reviewer's comment could come across as a bit racist (i.e. quickly assuming the root cause of a problem is the other person's difference in culture.   Well then, I guess that reviewer must be from outside Texas so anything she says cannot be right!)\n\nTwo final thoughts... I am local to Houston as are the friends I have recommended.  To my knowledge, all the treatments have been on an out-patient basis.  I did encounter a physician assistant a while ago that was not very helpful and seemed a bit rude.  She did some of the background discussions before seeing the doctor.  She is no longer there.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:36:05Z","yelp_user_id":"ETsfWo36bO6xNSTlSi2YUA"},{"business_id":"_ca5aBGIxqq-BBkuFACQUw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:07:59Z","date":"2009-01-05","review_id":"v4l_fxeZDSIlAaTq5kiiQA","stars":1,"text":"The Good  \nUm, well he looks good for being 70 years old.  \n\nThe Bad  \nHis bedside manner lacks severely if you question him about anything.

I was berated for questioning him and made to feel like I was to blame for his headache. My husband ended up getting 2 kidney stones and was immediately pulled off the Topamax 2 days after my questioning him. He may be good at treating some headaches, but he needs 2 lessons: 1) in US culture (yes women are allowed to ask questions here) and 2) bedside manner.

It was just the she didn't understand our question, nor our order--not that she was being uncaring. Nevertheless, don't go here if you want to eat vegetarian. My impression is that it is very authentic Chinese food because there were a lot of Chinese patrons there, so if you are going for an authentic meat dish this place might be just the ticket. Otherwise you should head to a local Indian place. The veg options were definitely NOT great here. Too fried, little vegetables.

On the plus side, they were pretty nice and helped me find the right pet. Staff were personable and friendly and the process for adopting was pretty fast and easy - there was minimal paperwork involved and no formal interview. I love my puppy and she has been happy and energetic since I got her.\n\nOn the other hand, the volunteers that work in the dog rooms aren't very knowledgeable about breeds...they were completely uninformed about different breeds what breeds mixes specific dogs there were. I wouldve expected volunteers and staff to be more knowledgeable. they also didnt interview me to see if my pup was an appropriate fit for me or my living situation, which made me feel like they were just trying to get rid of their dogs. they also left out a lot of information and guidance about taking my puppy home (ie. that I shouldnt take her outside or around other dogs until she's done her vaccinations...) and really just shoved a few pamphlets in my face before sending me to the in-house pet shop with a $2 coupon.  My pup is due for another shot and I have called their vet 3 times now and left messages...they do not answer that phone or return calls. Ive since made an appt at another vet and wont be returning except for obedience classes...\n\n All in all, it was a pretty good experience and I would recommend AHS to friends but do your homework on breeds and pet care before you go and dont expect them to provide much there.  Also, I wouldnt count on them for vet services - if they cant return my call, I'm not trusting them with my new friend!

I tried a BLT and Avocado sandwich and the bread was toasted just right, the bacon was crispy and didn't have gristle, the avocado was ripe, and it came with a side of vinegar/green pea salad, which tasted great.\n\n- The cocktails are inventive and strong.  I had a particularly potent pineapple tequila cocktail that gave me a totally bitching vertigo episode!\n\n-  The free wi-fi.  Decent internet speeds.  \n\nReasons to dislike this place:\n\n- Price.  As a Manhattan cafe geared toward Americans with too much money, they feel completely comfortable charging $10 for a BLT sandwich and $10 for a cocktail.  I'm used to going to little deli convenience stores and getting an even better sandwich for $4-$5. If they want the price to justify what you get, they ought to think about making the sandwiches much bigger.  I was still hungry after my $10 BLT sandwich which just makes the whole thing an illogical meal.  Why would I come up here and pay $10 for a smaller sandwich if I can walk 1 block and get a huge and delicious sandwich for $4-$5 at Andy's Deli?  I expected that the price would be a little higher because of the arrogant yuppie factor, but come on, there's no way this BLT sandwich is worth $10.  \n\n- Automatic gratuity.  I'm a pretty good tipper.  Having worked for years as a server, I understand that good service should always get at least 20-25%, but at the same time, I frown upon places that slap an automatic 18%.  The only thing this policy does is removes the incentives for the service to actually be good.  It was a somewhat obvious symptom here because although the server was friendly and lively, she wasn't very attentive nor reachable.  I was still planning on giving her about 20% regardless, but I think automatic gratuity is a sleazy concept.  It's a gesture of hostility to the guests and implicitly states that customers can't be trusted.  I ended up leaving less money (the obligatory 18%) than I would have left (I was thinking 20-22% in this case) because I felt insulted.  \n\n So, one pineapple cocktail and a BLT sat me back $25 when you take into account the tax and mandatory tip.  The lunch was definitely not worth $25 in my opinion.  I would have much rather had a $4.95 falafel sandwich from Soom Soom or Maoz instead of paying $25 for the lunch I had here.  \n\n- Comfort.  Although I said earlier that the atmosphere is cozy, the seats aren't!  People are sat close together and in rigid chairs.  I ended up sitting at the elevated bar stools so I can have my personal space, but the chairs were too uncomfortable to sit there and get some serious writing done like I had originally planned.  Also, there are no power outlets for laptops.\n\n- The hipster and yuppie factor. Tables with glued pennies underneath the glass in an attempt to be postmodern. Nuff said.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:42:46Z","yelp_user_id":"X60MhC89BL--J13kXdV0cg"},{"business_id":"_Dc5E16rCL16j2xsUHw18Q","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:40:44Z","date":"2008-07-23","review_id":"5z5oNR1rvOudXeas_MhrZw","stars":1,"text":"Went here to meet a girlfriend the other night at around 7.

When it was time to leave, the server came over and apologetically said that their computer system was down. He then said that he could compute the bill manually but that he preferred not to- could we just remember how much we paid and then pay in cash? \n\nI found it odd that he couldn't compute the bill manually- do they not have a backup calcuator in the place?- and that somehow this became our responsibility. Nonetheless, because we were anxious to leave we started working backward and came up with a total. In the middle of this, though, the server reappeared and asked us for our patience- the computer would start working again soon.\n\nSo we waited about 40 more minutes for the computer to work. Didn't happen. Then the server came over and said that we owed about 20 dollars more than we thought, unnecessarily adding \"there was a lot of booze\" (which there wasn't- maybe a total of five glasses of wine among six people). When we asked for an itemized list, he again groaned and said that it was too hard to remember. Are we that dependent on computers nowadays that we can't keep track of a few glasses of wine and desserts? \n\nAs it turned out, the extra money came on two extra glasses of wine I had ordered. I ordered a \"cheap\" glass (their words) for $6, and when I ordered two additional ones I expected them to bring me more of the cheap. Instead, they brought me the more expensive $9 glasses without being asked! Realizing this, I protested but was told that I had to specify that I wanted to continue drinking the cheap wine. Like there's a default setting on wine, or whatever.\n\nSo sorry, Sip. Gave you a shot, and you blew it. Back to 1020 and the local dives, where at least they're honest.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:15:27Z","yelp_user_id":"8ecmVyYuVWkbHztezGs3mw"},{"business_id":"_Dc5E16rCL16j2xsUHw18Q","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:59:32Z","date":"2011-05-03","review_id":"9z2iCz3ff2IMWG_5DlmJnQ","stars":1,"text":"So after two years of basically living a couple blocks away from SIP, I decided to give it a try and was totally disappointed.\n\nFirst, I tried ordering two things on the menu (both were associated with the happy hour) and they were \"out\" of both of them.

Although I did enjoy my beverage (third choice was a charm) my experience was disrupted by constantly trying to get the waiter's attention.\n\nThird, The AUTOMATIC SURCHARGE of 18%, sealed the deal for me that this place was a one-timer. Honestly, we just had two drinks and had an 18% charge on our bill. The bill also gives you advice on what more you can tip below (different percentages with different prices). If I didn't look close enough I would not have realized I was already charged for the tip. I have never been to a restaurant that does this anywhere else ever (there was only 2 of us and we just had drinks). NICE TRY SIP--never again.

The place is small/cozy but not cramped, has many different seating options, outlets and wifi for the laptop luggers, decent prices on food and drink, and serves food, coffee/tea, and liquor!  Also, the whole Open 'Til 4am thing makes me squeal with delight.\n\nThe caveats are as follows:\n\nOutlets - there are only outlets along the wall with the bar-height seating and in the back.  So laptop people are limited to those spaces.\n\nBusy Times - Weekends they serve brunch until about 4pm, which means a lot of people coming in and perhaps less tolerance for people taking up a table forever.  Happy Hour begins at 5 and goes until 7 each day, and the woman behind the counter informed me that it's a pretty busy time.  So, for weekdays, it looks like before 5 is best.  For weekends, after 7.  But, again, open until 4 am...\n\nFor writers - If you have a small group of writers (no more than 5) you should be fine sitting in the area in the back.  But if, when you arrive, that is taken, you're totally SOL.  I would suggest writing dates with one or two other people at the most.

Seems like a great place to chill if you live in the neighborhood - free wifi, great coffee (bonus points for the french press), fun music.  And the food was quite yummy.  I had some kind of egg + chorizo + potato yumminess.\n\nBut here's the rub - it's trying to be all things to all people: a wifi cafe, a bar, a restaurant, and it doesn't have the ability (or the space) to be any more than one at a time.  The tables aren't really big enough to hold food, coffee, utensils, etc. for two people.  And if you come with a laptop, aren't you taking up a table for someone who might want to eat?  There's only about 12 tables in the place.  Also, it's long and narrow, so I can only imagine the bottle neck at the bar on a crowded night.  I'm being nitpicky, I guess, but it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, I have to call out the decor - weirdly Abraham Lincoln/Penny themed.  Whoever glued all those pennies in a row to EVERY surface deserves a medal.  Love the local art on the walls too.  All in all a good place to try in a very up and coming part of town.

Salmon was also good but is no longer on the menu.  \n-They use fresh squeezed grapefruit juice in their drinks. \n-The imported pastries are good, love the macaroons. \n-The vibe is chill, and nice eclectic tunes, as others have noted.

The sea bass came very overcooked, the bananas foster needed more rum or liqueur to cut the overpowering sweetness of dish, and although the components in the ceasar salad were tasty (fresh romaine, parmesan tuile), it was so awkward to eat, served vertically, with whole pieces of romaine that already have dressing on them. You can't eat it with your hands and dip the dressing without getting dressing all over your hands, and you can't eat it with a fork because the romaine hearts are 8 inches long, and you can't cut it up because the plate is too small. \n-I love that the grapefruit juice is squeezed there, but the seeds need to be strained out. \n-Service can be reaaalllyy sslllooow with only one server for the entire place\n-the seating is awkward, since the hard chairs are about 6 inches higher than the vinyl seats, which are much too low for the tables.

He said there was just no possible way to change it. NOTHING he could do.

However, as a life long NYer who has observed and experienced a lot of significant change in the city over more than a decade, it's nice to know a place like Sip exists in Northern Manhattan.  \n\nAs many folks in New York City are aware of most lounges, bars and clubs in Manhattan that are located away from the central nightlife areas don't really address the interests of folks who fall out of line with mainstream culture. Then factor in that there has been a mainstreaming of lower Manhattan's nightlife. In other words local neighborhoods are increasingly starved for quality nightlife. \n\nFor folks Uptown or the on Upper West Side the options have been slim other than the typical bar with 10 flat screen TVs playing 5 different sports, and a few hip looking lounges and clubs here and there that have DJs spinning top 40 and a little dance music (if you're lucky). \n\nFortunately, Sip is a great space, albeit small, for local \"downtown/bohemian\" types, but isn't pretentious enough to scare off folks who are not into that scene. Sure, they also serve bistro food, have Wi-Fi, an all-you-can drink brunch on weekends, and the vibe at night is on point. \n\nYou could ask why have DJs in such a narrow space, but Sip is clearly a haven for Uptowners that want something different. It's part lounge, bar, coffee shop, bistro, art gallery. With new artists work displayed on its walls constantly changing, and resident DJs spinning eclectic mixes of music ranging from electronica, funk, hip-hop (often old school and mash-ups), electro, baile funk, house and reggae (more dancehall) it provides a much needed alternative for those in the area.\n\nThose wondering why they don't see DJ's all of the time is because they play at night, mostly, although DJ Dan plays during Brunch on Sunday (I believe).\n\nFridays are now with DJ Know1 who spins more hip-hop, afro-beat, reggae, funk/soul\n\nWhen I played there I used to spin a bit more of a electronic music set with house, electro, detroit techno, baile funk/mash-ups and nudisco, but I always played hip-hop, soul, re-edits, afro-beat, and reggae.\n\nThey also have happy hour from 2-4am which is great for the late night crowd.\n\nIt can get pretty crowded some weekends, but not always. The crowd is often very mixed, which is often why we play to so many music types, and there are local heads who come in all of the time that constantly come through. Also, when the weather gets warm the entire front of the place is open which is very cool. The fact is that there are few spots like it in the area, so if you do live nearby it's worth coming either for a meal or a night out.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:22:14Z","yelp_user_id":"nR1WBy1C_LahL0e_HA040Q"},{"business_id":"_Dc5E16rCL16j2xsUHw18Q","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:22:11Z","date":"2010-12-19","review_id":"kNrhmVypT71Pj_3hbjvfWw","stars":3,"text":"Tasty food and drinks, but a little expensive and crowded.

I've only been here once as a booze patron, on a night of bar hopping during orientation week at school.  I had nothing bad to say about Sip-as-bar, but I admit I was already in good company, ethanol-happy, and seated at the edge of the patio area.  No complaints.\n\nThat having been said, I can see where the experience might have been less than stellar for the dedicated bar hopper, at least in respect of the size of the place.  No other boozer data to share.\n\nInstead, the few times I've been here, I've been attracted by the signs offering off-peak cheap(er) food and coffee combos.  Just now, I had not one, but two of the \"Sipwich\" $4 sandwich and coffee combos.  They were fabulous, even factoring in the fact that I was starving when I stepped through the door: the \"billionaire bacon\" followed by the chorizo version.  Both were generous and mouthwatering.\n\nSeating when I've done the off-peak thing has always been comfortable.  Cheerful environment, and genuinely friendly service.

Now I did enjoy my drink. I'd agree with the owner that it was probably a bit on the big side (not that this says anything about actual alcohol content). But the mood was spoiled as follows:\n\nI get a bill back for $16 and change. After reviewing the bill I see $13 for a drink (sticker shock right there), a dollar and change for tax...and 18% automatic gratuity, adding another $2.50 or so to the bill; I'd had no intention of treating myself for $16, and if I had I could have gone to 1020 and had 3 beers (including tip) for that price. Now if the $13 was the end of it I would have left feeling a bit grumpy for unwittingly ordered a $13 drink, but I wold have gotten over it and probably wouldn't be writing this review. But the sleaze factor of their gratuity system is what inspired this review.\n\nSo I called the server over, and told him that while I can accept that I probably ought to have asked how much the drink was and that I'm not complaining about that, I've never heard of having automatic gratuity tacked on just for sitting down and having a drink. He shows me the menu with this policy (which I never saw because I just ordered my drink directly), so seeing that it would be more trouble that it was worth to make a case, I sign my bill. (And to add insult to injury, there is still a gratuity line on the bill.)\n\nAt this point I am greeted by someone who asks me what the problem is. I kindly explain to him, too, that it's my fault for not asking for the price but that I really don't appreciate this business of 18% gratuity and I've never heard of this for just sitting down and ordering A drink. He says it's on the menu too, and that's how the computer system works; as I pointed out to him, someone had to make the decision for the computer system to work that way.\n\nSo anyways in all of this I ask him if he's the owner; he is. He tells me that the servers tell you when they bring you the check about the 18% thing...which I actually wasn't, but anyways, it's kind of too late at that point now isn't it? I explained that maybe you should make that a little more obvious, post a sign or something, instead of hiding it in small print at the bottom of the menu, where someone just ordering a drink probably won't even see it. He said \"suggestion taken\" in a tone of voice that suggested to me \"please go away now.\"\n\nTo his credit he did eventually agree to void my original check and just have me pay the drink + tax. But again, I kind of feel like it was only because it was pretty obvious I wasn't going away until I got an answer that didn't sound like him trying to excuse ripping me off. It really is rather hard to not feel like this is a rather underhanded business tactic--like I said, prices is one thing and it's your fault for just blindly ordering; and you expect to pay automatic gratuity on say a party of 5 or 6; but come on, this is just sticking their hands in people's pockets.\n\nFrom the other reviews I'm apparently not the only one who feels like they're trying to be sleazy about it, either; another review says the brunch menu straight up does not mention the auto gratuity, yet they charge it anyways. Tip to the owner: the business I go back (and insist that other people join me in going to) to are the ones that treat me well, not the ones that make me leave feeling ripped off.\n\nI MIGHT come back for say the happy hours with free tapas (then I might feel like all the gratuity and what-not was justified), but not just for a drink. And trust me, I'll be scrutinizing the price of every last thing before I agree to have it brought to me. It's probably more enjoyable too (three or four stars, which I felt up until the bill fiasco) if you know that you're looking at having this 18% tacked on instead of having it surprise you at the end.\n\nSo yeah, buyer beware.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:31:00Z","yelp_user_id":"p5NGa1mGw-nHB6rAf7v9Tw"},{"business_id":"_Dc5E16rCL16j2xsUHw18Q","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:14:21Z","date":"2007-03-11","review_id":"Wfcey-E-0p7J4VKTYse2YQ","stars":3,"text":"I've only visited at night when it's a bar.

Prices are generally reasonable on their used stuff, though I wouldn't go so far as to say cheap (at least not for any good albums in decent shape).

Originally, my friends and I went there because it was open late (typically 24-hours) and served great food.  Now I stop in for lunch on the weekend or for a quick dinner when I'm in the area.\n\nThe diner's menu is pretty diverse, as they offer breakfast, typical diner food, and fancier stuff.  We usually stick with the classic-diner fare though, and are never disappointed.  A few of our favorite appetizers are the Cheese Fries, waffle fries, and Disco Fries (fries with melted American cheese and brown gravy).  Perfect diner stuff.\n\nSalads are good, though some of my friends think the Cesar salad is a little heavy-handed with the dressing.  The sandwiches are hearty and can be served with fries or waffle fries (go for the waffle!).  The breakfast food is also good.  You get pretty big portions and there's a good mix of classic and more inventive breakfast items.\n\nTwo other things that my friends like about the Route 9 Diner: they do serve beer/wine, and there's a glass case with rotating desserts.  ;o)  \n\nWaitstaff is typically nice enough -- not too absent, not too in-your-business.

A customer shouldn't have to ask for a buffet item to be refilled. It's a buffet for gods sake! There's supposed to be food in the trays... not just a little rice and some cold nan bread. \n\nToday we went in for the buffet at 1 PM (it ends at 2:30pm). The tables were roughly 1/4 full. It wasn't busy. \n\nWe go up to the buffet and notice there's no entrees! Well, OK there was one... there was tandori chicken that had obviously been sitting there for hours... all dried out. \n\nI asked the waitress to refill the tikki marsala and she passed that on to the owner. My friend swears he heard the owner say though the curtain that divides the kitchen and the dining area... \"let them wait\".\n\nThe owner came out 5 minutes later and stirred the empty buffet trays again (why does he keep stirring empty trays?). I asked him about the tikki marsala and he said it would be \"a long while\". I said.. \"a long while?!\"\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of absolutely no food coming out of the kitchen we walk to the register to cash out. My friend doesn't want to to ask for a discount but I do. If he wants to pay full price for dry rice and old, dry tandori chicken, that's his choice. \n\nI ask for a discount and the waitress calls in the manager/owner. He's the old, Indian guy with the glasses, a perpetually filthy apron and the Tom Selleck mustache. He comes over and I politely ask for a discount because there's no entrees available and hasn't been since we came in 20 minutes ago. He gets all belligerent with me and starts yelling. He's creating a scene in his restaurant. I guess he assumes that I'll back down and just pay if he yells really loud and causes a scene. \n\nHe says that it's our fault because we didn't check to see if there was any food in the trays BEFORE sitting down and ordering drinks! I swear to god he said that. We're supposed to make sure a buffet has food before we sit down and order drinks?! Are you kidding me?! It's a buffet! It's supposed to have food all the time!!! LOL!!!!\n\nWhen he refuses even a small discount, I refuse to pay at all. He threatens to call the police and I tell him to go ahead. I'm sure the cops will come and see that there's no food and side with me. \n\nHe won't call the cops but continues to yell louder and louder... until finally the restaurant is dead quiet and everyone is focused on our conversation. \n\nI offer to show him that there's no food but he won't budge. He says no discount and I can't leave without paying full price OR he'll call the cops. But, he won't really call the cops because he knows I'm right.. \n\nEventually, my extremely non-confrontational S/O insists on paying for both our \"lunches\" on his credit card and we leave. I tell the rude belligerent unappreciative owner that we're never coming back again and he just lost 2 good customers.

I think they are useless, overcrowded, toasters-on-wheels that only exist to serve those too lazy to walk or too cheap to drive (or too cheap to pay that extra 55 cents to take the subway for that matter).  I have had a car since I was old enough to drive (seeing that I live in the suburbs it was necessary) but yet I do think it can be economical and (sometimes) faster to take public transportation when going downtown.  I have loathed the bus system for a long time but I went against everything I believe in and took the #1 to Harvard from Hynes a few weeks ago to please a friend who didn't feel like going out of the way to transfer at Park St (understandable since we all know the subway system here never works properly either).  Not only did the bus that was supposed to come every 10-12 minutes make us wait for 20 minutes but once we got on it was unbearably packed, and of course had to stop at EVERY corner along Mass. Ave.!!!  Most of the time people are, unfortunately, standing intimately close to one another so when a seat up front FINALLY became available (3 stops before the end of the route) I took it, only to be belittled by a guy who was likely homeless and definately ignorant, sitting behind me.  The next part will (hopefully) appall you and take you by surprise!  The convo went something like this:\n\nIgnorant Homeless Guy: \"Why are you sitting there?  It is for disabled and elderly people?\"\n\nMe: \"I beg your pardon?  There are no disabled or elderly people here so I'm allowed to sit\"\n\nI.H.G.: \"That guy over there (pointing to a 50 year old guy who was standing 5 people away from me accross the aisle, happily chatting to a friend) looks over 65. You should offer him your seat.\"\n\nMe: \"That guy does not look 65 to me. And he is in the middle of talking with someone.  If he wants my seat, he can come ask me to sit and I will gladly get up for him.  Besides, I don't feel it is really any of your concern\"\n\nI.H.G.: \"Do you think you are disabled because you are heavy?  It's amazing what heavy people try to get away with...acting as if their weight makes them disabled!  It's digusting.\"\n\nMe: \"Excuse me?  I'm not THAT big.

The nurses in the clinics are helpful and they didn't act like we were intruding when we had questions.  The hospital staff (from the floor nurses to the residents) made us feel like my sister was being taken care of while she was there.  \n\nNegatives:  Some of the doctors needed better bed-side manners (the residents are much better - it seems the more experienced and teaching doctors have somehow gotten detached from their patients).  Social workers - I had a good experience with MD Anderson until I had to deal with the social workers.  They were non-responsive - their job was to coordinate my sister's discharge to hospice care.  I ended up going onto the internet and searching for hospice care companies to followup on who can take her.  It's a tough time for families at this point and their attitudes and performance does not help with the situation.\n\nThe treatments at MD Anderson were not successful for my sister and she passed away this past June.

This was at a different hospital with different doctors. The end result was him being cancer free - worse for wear - but supposedly cancer free. \n\nNot so fast.\n\nA couple years later, he went back for a checkup to those same doctors who told him he was fine. But something wasn't right. So, we signed him up at MD Anderson for a second opinion. Thank God we did. Because they found a major recurrence of the same cancer he was supposedly healed from. At stage 4. Before he had the chance to die from it.\n\nBefore we could blink an eye, he was already in treatment. And in the hands of the leading expert on his type of cancer, no less. Dr. Jaffer Ajani, our somewhat introverted doctor, had our entire faith in his hands. And for good reason.\n\nIt paid off. \n\nAlthough my dad will never be free of this cancer (at least, not in the near term), they shrunk that stuff down to size. He feels great again and will continue to be in periodic care/management at MD Anderson. And that will make us breathe easier.\n\nThe entire experience of cancer sucks for everyone involved. If there is one major, MAJOR part of it that makes it somewhat bearable, it's the care of the people, the technology and the process at MD Anderson. The entire process was so unbelievably efficient - even in such a huge facility - it made us wonder over and over again on how they are able to do it. The technology is the absolute latest and greatest. And the people? Well, they have a sincere passion for what they do (I'm leaving out the exception of one nurse we had issues with that were soon \"resolved\"). Passion drives greatness.

This review is purely from a member of a patient's family's standpoint and will provide tips that will hopefully help you around your way at MD Anderson.\n\nIf you're reading this review, you're probably looking for some insight from others whom have had experience with this facility and I hope this information I provide could help.\n\nMD Anderson is the epitome of world class service. The phrase \"You pay for what you get\" is certainly true, however, given the high cost of medical fees and high degree of care and services offered, there are always certain areas that can be improved to make MD Anderson an even better Cancer Center. \n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT DOCTOR\n\nTo begin, I would like to stress the importance of choosing the right doctor. Like any medical facility, there are doctors who tend to focus more on a clinical approach while others are more interested in experimental approaches. Make sure you find out which approach works best for you and your family before choosing a doctor. I say this because it is often very difficult to switch doctors after you've made a choice. Also keep in mind the doctor's reputation. You will need to do a lot of research on this and probably visit the facility yourself. Like any caring family member, I was making phone calls left to right, searching online etc, to find the best oncologist at MD Anderson. Let me save you the time and say that no one at MD Anderson will tell you. What you need to be asking instead is \"which doctor has the busiest schedule?\". The \"busy-ness\" factor represents his/her popularity/demand and this will be the proxy for a doctor's ranking. As far as oncologists goes, I found out there are 2 breast cancer oncologists with very busy schedules currently at MD Anderson. To find out which doctors have the busiest schedules, you'll need to contact each doctor's assistant. Each doctor has an assistant whom does all the scheduling for patients so it's best to contact them directly.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nSecondly, make sure you have insurance and that your insurance company approves your treatment at MD Anderson. Luckily, we had insurance and they cover 90% of the cost. But for the sake of simplicity, I'll list all costs without insurance. If you do not have insurance, then there is an initial fee of ~$21000 USD paid up front which does not include any medical scans or procedures. Medical scans such as CT scans, ultrasound, x-rays cost about $2400-$3000 per scan. If your cancer treatment requires surgery, you will most likely have to stay in the hospital for at least 5 days. Surgery cost differs for each type of surgery, so I won't get in to that as I have no idea what the costs are for other surgeries other than the one my family member had. However, hospital stays are about $2000 per night, with the first night of in the range of $5000-$6000.\n\nGET A MAP\n\nYes, get a map. No matter how abundant the signs are inside the buildings, you will still need a map for your first few visits. MD Anderson has several buildings and you will most likely be visiting the Mays Clinic and/or Main Building the most. These 2 buildings are connected via a LONG and enclosed bridge. You can walk it, but MD Anderson also offers free shuttle (more like golf carts) every 2-3 minutes, so people with problems walking can use those instead. Both buildings are huge and appear as if they're made like a maze. This is particularly the case with the Main Building where one can easily get lost by making a wrong turn. There are also numerous entrances and parking garages at MD Anderson. When you are making an appointment for the first time, remember to as which entrance and garage you should use. On a related note, if you are visiting the facility the first time, you are entitled for free valet parking. Make sure you get it validated. \n\nSURGERY\n\nDuring surgery, family members will be waiting at a designated waiting area on the same floor as the operating room. Also during surgery, your surgeon will contact any family members via a phone at the reception desk of the waiting room for updates regarding the status of the surgery. After the surgery, the surgeon will come out to talk to the family members about the surgery in a private room. \n\nHOSPITAL ROOMS\n\nRegarding the hospital rooms, you are allowed 1 person to stay  with the patient during the nights. Each room has a 1-person couch which folds out into a bed. Patients are free to order food from a limited menu via phone (very much like room service at a hotel). All costs associated with food and drinks are included, so eat and drink up! Nurses comes about every 30min to an hour to check on the patients vital signs, so if someone is staying with the patient overnight, let them be warned that he/she may not get a good night's rest.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:01:09Z","yelp_user_id":"Q831MtihRwWIL1lufRluqw"},{"business_id":"_Ee3w-GvLi5CCjpauRIepA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:18:21Z","date":"2011-02-21","review_id":"SxSheoCMQsw9ikSayS6DQQ","stars":5,"text":"I have been coming to MD Anderson since 2009.

What a wonderful program and it is so helpful to patients.\n\nOne of the best things about the hospital is the available services when you need it.  MRI, CT scans, x-rays, etc. are available quickly if not immediately.

I really wish I could give the shop one rating, and my hair stylist a separate rating, because to be honest the shop sucks.  It's in a cute little area with lots of charm, but the owner has no clue.  First off, if you go in on a weekend, there is hardly any seating, so if you have to wait, they make you sit in the back under a hairdryer while you wait for your hair stylist. They really need to rethink the layout of the front of the shop.  Second, if your there when it's busy, they tend to blow electrical fusses left and right.  Third, I can't believe Aveda would lower their standards, this place looks like it was thrown together with no thought, no time, and no style.  None of the furniture matches, you get the feeling the owner was trying to piece this place together as cheaply as possible.  Several of the wall posters are wrinkled, with cracked frames, and there are spackle marks all over the walls that need to be painted. Another thing that really bothered me, was that the first time I went in to the shop I requested someone I had never met, due to word of mouth.  When I got there they had given me to some other hair stylist.  I didn't find out until half way through my appointment, that the person doing my hair wasn't the same person I had requested. The only reason I went back for a second round is because while I was there, I met this other hairstylist, who seemed to know her stuff. I personally feel, that if I have to pay Aveda prices, the store should be held to higher standards. Don't get me wrong this place has potential.  Hopefully, the owner will catch on.  \n\nAs far as my stylist.  She's fantastic, I would five her 5 stars if I could.  Her name is Ivy.  I've only seen her a few times, so far, but every time she blows me away.  She is so up beat and fun to talk to, and she does a great job with hair color, cuts, and crazy frizzy curly hair.

It seemed like she had never done one before.  She used the worst brush possible for my type of hair (super straight) and it took forever.  Once she was finished and handed me the mirror I could see the horror.  I quickly paid and got out of there--unsure how or if I could demand a refund.  When I got home and brushed it straight I discovered the extent of the damage.  She missed whole sections of bangs leaving very long pieces mixed in with the shorter.  And then the layers.  It looked as if I let my five year old sister cut my hair.\n\nI scoured the net and found that Sugar, a salon in Silverlake, was open on Sundays.

I usually ask him to layer my hair, and he does an excellent job. Even my friends love it! Chuck only charges only $30 for a haircut and shampoo in Pasadena. Where else will you find a better deal than that in Pasadena?\nChuck really knows hair. He knows exactly how hair should be cut and treated. He knows which products to use and which ones to avoid. You can ask him. For example, the Brazilian Blowout is a scam. Chuck is aware that there are unethical hair stylists out there who just want to make a quick buck, fool people, and end up damaging people's hair. Chuck is an ethical and honest hair stylist. He gives you exactly what you need. He will not charge outrageously high prices nor will he pressure you into caving in for additional unnecessary services. That's what I love about Chuck and the hair stylists of Beyond Hair. They are honest, hard-working hair stylists who are willing to do their best for their clients.\n\nBe cautious about some of those one-star Yelp reviews here. Some of them are absolutely unreliable. Have you noticed that they don't even create a Yelp profile? They never leave reviews for any other businesses. Those one-time, one-star Yelpers purposely want to malign a business more than to leave an honest review which is very unfair and untruthful. They tend to be those nightmare customers that no hair salon would ever want to have as their client. Take it from me. Don't believe them for a second because there are two sides to every coin. Which reviews would you rather believe? A one-time impossible-to-please client or a long-time client who voices good reason on why she returns.\n\nHere are more reasons why I love to go to Beyond Hair. Chuck is very sociable and fun to talk to. You can even friend him on Facebook. There's nothing dryer than a boring, mute hair stylist. I'm glad that Chuck is the complete opposite of that. Chuck is not only a hair stylist but also a DJ. He plays great music while he shampoos and cuts your hair. He's a great person to talk to if you're really into music. You can talk to him about all kinds of rock musicians and rock bands especially Queen which is one of his favorites. You can talk to Chuck about collectibles too. He'll give you advice on how to make money on collectibles and how to not get ripped off by expensive concert tickets. \nThey don't just cut hair at Beyond Hair but they also dye hair too. They can also trim your bangs for free after you had your haircut a while ago with them. Beyond Hair really cares about their clients, and they go above and beyond with their customer service. What more can I say? I love Beyond Hair!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:23:13Z","yelp_user_id":"-REM6LpgajtMimuHbs_SuA"}]},{"business":{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","city":"Los Angeles","created_at":"2013-03-15T06:42:42Z","full_address":"1116 Westwood Blvd\nWestwood\nLos Angeles, CA 90024","latitude":34.0604,"longitude":-118.445,"name":"The Stand","open":true,"photo_url":"http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/it4Zxxcvns4KW11NgtZECw/ms.jpg","review_count":220,"stars":3.5,"state":"CA","updated_at":"2013-03-15T06:42:42Z","url":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-stand-los-angeles-5"},"reviews":[{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T15:26:29Z","date":"2010-11-06","review_id":"_9O5lMtFAoZW2J20O7r8TA","stars":3,"text":"It is a decent place for burger and hotdog.

Chalk it up to the overwhelming cheap student population that frequents the 'wood, or the sub-par walk- and park-ability of the neighborhood, but in my 4 years living in Westwood and 2 living out of it, I've seen a lot of places come and go (recall: U-Dog, Charro Chicken, Olive Garden, Hawaii Ono, Boba World, and Marvin's Diner, to name a few (Source: http://westsidetoday.com/s3-404/westwood-restaurants-come-and.html)). Sadly, I foresee a similar future for The Stand.\n\nTo its benefit, The Stand has a few unique items. Its dogs hail from a variety of regions (Midtown, Chicago, Boston, LA (bacon-wrapped....mmmmm)), and there's an OK selection of sausages (Italian, Low-Fat Texas Turkey, Low-Fat Chicken Apple). Add to that a decent representation of American diner classics (Spinach Salad, Baked Beans, Tuna Melt, New York Cheesecake), a few foodie-friendly-ish items (Garlic Mushrooms, Knishes, Apple-Cranberry Cobbler, Stand Honey Blond Ale), and you've got yourself a C menu. Nothing terribly fancy, but there are certainly more boring menus out there.\n\nFor lunch today I had the Big Blue Dog, which is a grilled dog with bleu cheese, grilled onions, tomato, and a chipotle bbq sauce. I subbed fries for the chips, and ordered a cream soda.\n\nMy first disappointment was the cream soda. On the south wall of the restaurant there is a sign asking, \"When was the last time you had cream soda ON TAP?\" Well, my answer at 11:45 this morning was Never, and if you were to ask me that right now, it would still be, Never. I was handed a bottle of Thomas Kemper Vanilla Cream soda, and sent on my way. Never mind that it was a good Cream Soda...I felt only slightly deceived.\n\nThe dog was a mixed experience. The bun was too small and soft for the amount of ingredients that went into it. It might be more \"traditional\" to steam a standard-sized bun, but like a good pizza crust, the supporting cast is there to, well, support the star. Buns that are bigger and toasted would do these heavily-loaded dogs greater justice.\n\nAs for the main events, the onions were great, the dog itself had a satisfying snap, and the chipotle bbq sauce was so good I almost asked for some for my fries. The fries, however, were the low point of the meal. Undercooked and flacid from sitting under the dog, they were unseasoned and not hot. Both of these are easy problems to fix: fry longer, throw some salt in there, use bigger plates so that the stage isn't so crowded. But the fact that these issues haven't been addressed yet is troubling.\n\nThe service was good - the waiter approached us during our meal to ask if everything was OK - and the atmosphere is fun. The fact that they have a liquor license is to their advantage, maugre the restaurant's small size. To ensure that they stay afloat during these tough economic times, they're even doing Dollar Dogs on Monday nights, although I didn't notice any deals on alcohol.\n\nBest of luck, The Stand. Here's to hoping that you don't go the way of Skews.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:23:33Z","yelp_user_id":"ysVLjIHnZqhoEsRa6hwXkw"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:40:15Z","date":"2009-12-05","review_id":"4FcUsMNF9yhAG4yqohHQzw","stars":3,"text":"Will have to go back for the food but the drinks deals are amazing.

Someone please fix this.\n\nNow, I would actually rate The Stand 3 1/2 stars.  It's very cute in a yuppie sort of way, which is ok but not great.  Clean anyway.  As we're \"when in Rome\" kind of people we had the Stand Dogs.  They were pretty good, but unless you have a coupon, they're too expensive for hot dogs.  You do get chips, whether you really want them or not, which I don't consider a good thing since some of them were crispy, but some were soggy (the worst!) and some were part crispy-part soggy.  Ugh.  Plus they're just tempting unwanted calories daring you to stare at them but not eat.  Good luck.  I suppose they think they're 'giving' you something extra so they can charge you $4-5 for something that should really be $2.50.  Then what really ruined it for me was that I asked for yellow mustard (traditional hot dog stuff, right?) and my husband asked for deli mustard, in addition to the other toppings we each ordered, and yet mine came out with deli mustard and my hubby's with yellow.  This may not sound like a big deal to you, but we don't usually eat junk food, so this was a big foray for us, and I was trying to replicate a Chicago dog (didn't see that they actually have one on the menu) and yellow mustard is crucial.  As soon as I took a bite I said HEY! and looked closer and saw deli mustard.  And we couldn't just trade dogs because I had onions and hubby is allergic.  Either write it down or get it right, please!

It was only 8 PM and I was not amidst one of my proudest moments. I was craving Asian food, but my friend was hell bent on going here... whatever. \n\nSo we roll in and I timidly approach the counter aghast at the size of the menu above the counter. My paper thin attention span and blurred vision did not serve me well in navigating the relatively fine print. The girls at the counter could likely sense and smell our stupor and pointed us to the much condensed specialty menu at eye level and larger print to the right of the counter. I just went for the first thing on it... apparently their specialty...some kind of bbq meat sandwich.  I really do not recall if it was pork or beef. \n\nWe were then talked into draft beers which they claimed were only $1.50...I honestly have no clue if that was a lie or not...but the price listed for the beer was at least $3. More beer always seems like a great idea in these situations and I was as easy a sell as a spinster in a gigalo store. The beer was delicious by the way...their own honey wheat ale... i think... \n\nNow I normally can't resist giving women working behind counters a hard time... but put enough beer in me and give me an audience and I'll one up myself and lean a bit over the line. The girlfriend wasn't too amused and in an attempt to shut me up grabbed a plastic cup full of the self service sliced deli pickles for me to nibble on. This worked because if there's anything I love more than flirting it's garlic deli pickles...yummmmmmm. \n\nThe food showed up not too long afterward. I felt like I was high with Dave Chappelle and Co. in the film HALF BAKED...the sandwich was HUGE, and overflowing with thick cut gourmet kettle cooked chips. I just ate and ate until there was nothing left. It was very good... even though I still don't remember what kind of meat I ate.

My girlfriend ordered a side of chips which seemed to be freshly prepared and well seasoned.\n\nI'll likely be back as the Stand is relatively cheap and was a lot more filling than I had expected to be after eating just a hot dog.

In a bridging-the-gap fashion, the primary clientele here are young professionals, some of whom are recent grads of UCLA.  The other diners (like myself) are UCLA staff and students.  The cost of the food here matches that demographic: a stand(ard) burger with fries and drink will set you back about $9 after tax, a significant jump from the In-and-Outs of fast food affair.\n\nNevertheless, the menu selection is vast and I'm tempted to try so many things on it.  Thus far, I have had many of the hot dogs and brats.  They are cooked well, and have a variety of toppings to go with them.  I'm a fan of the chili dog, it's nice and chunky and doesn't make too much of a mess in your tray.  The sauerkraut was disappointing, it tasted like wet cabbage to me.\n\nOn my last trip I ordered the turkey burger per Traci T.'s recommendation.  Normally I wouldn't dare try a non-beef burger but I was in an experimental mood.  Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised by it.  It was crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside, and not at all a dry turkey sandwich that I had envisioned.  I'll definitely consider ordering it next time.\n\nThe locale is best for people who work/live around the area, as Westwood parking is tough to find and expensive.  It's relatively small but I enjoy the many TVs with ESPN along the walls.  I haven't tried the specialty drinks and beers yet, so I'll have something to look forward to when I enter into corporate America.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:36:28Z","yelp_user_id":"cqhKVrw9Tm_9T4vgneHTFA"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:58:35Z","date":"2011-02-01","review_id":"drwYW8YJZf7ea5cx_wc03A","stars":4,"text":"Overall: I like the food, prices, ambiance, speed of service, and friendly service.\n\nThe Good:\n  - chili dog\n  - french fries (they're worth the extra dollar)\n  - hamburgers (while I've never had one, the place was packed with customers chowing down on burgers, so I'm assuming it must be good)\n\nThe Okay:\n  - homemade chips (that come standard with meals; they're a little too hard)\n\nThe Bad:\n  - PARKING","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:24:46Z","yelp_user_id":"q1iaqNX6bpN9X3rRKnsh6g"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:54:22Z","date":"2011-02-18","review_id":"dS9yI2RvyDEkFWkQSfnZCg","stars":3,"text":"Decent Food.\nDecent Value.\nParking...Westwood.

But this menu does practically demand you try something new -- that large menu would just seem like a waste otherwise.\n\nI figured that, as I was at what is commonly viewed as a hot dog joint, I should get a hot dog.  But since my hot dog heart belongs to Dodger Dogs, I went healthy and got a low-fat turkey dog (you can choose from beef, turkey, kosher, or Big Red; you can also choose between beef and turkey for burgers).  Could I tell the difference?  No.  I got splashy with my toppings, though -- a Chicago dog.  Per the menu -- STEAMED DOG, PICKLES, DICED YELLOW ONIONS, DICED TOMATO, NEON RELISH, SPORT PEPPERS, MUSTARD & CELERY SALT.  In a word?  Delicious.  On a thick poppy seed bun, added ketchup, can't miss.  Comes with Stand Chips (just how I like em, thick and crunchy).  I added a healthy side -- fruit salad (standard melon and pineapple, still good).  With a Diet Coke, came in under ten bucks.\n\nAllie got a Cheeseburger (turkey) and it looked amazing.  She got fries to go with it, and while the fries don't look impressive, the one I stole was delicious -- had a little extra kick to it.\n\nWe rounded it off by splitting a chocolate chip cookie, which was just about perfect.  \n\nThe help was really nice and very helpful.  We waited a little longer than I would have liked to get our food (but it was 9:15 and they seemed to be closing up slowly).  The booths are comfy and they have lots of tables.  The be-framed postered walls are a little silly, especially since everything is so new, but it's hard to not look up at one of the advertised items on the posters and not get a tingle in your tummy.\n\nAll in all, a solid bet.

What they offer is an uniform service throughout all locations, but each location having their specials that are specific to their operation.  The Stand that I will be reviewing is the location in Westwood, by UCLA.  \n\nHot dogs, do me is considered the All-American cuisine.  Everyone at one point or another have had a hot dog.  What The Stand offers is a huge variation of hot dogs.  Their standard dog is the Chili Dog, which they do very well.  The chili is complex and they use real shredded cheese rather than slices of American cheese that covered in chili.  Their Kraut Dog uses their homemade sauerkraut, combined with a spicy mustard that gives it a little kick that one is not expecting from a traditional kraut dog.  We had a special order of fries...the fire fries that is fries that is pre-soaked in buffalo sauce, and then deep fried, so rather than having your fries covered in the sauce, the essence of the buffalo sauce is ingrained in every bite of the fries.  It's a manageable spice yet, do yourself a favor and not have soda with it or else you'll suffer the same consequence as me and the heat of the fries then becomes unmanageable.\n\nOverall, I hesitate to make this correlation, but I would consider The Stand to be the McDonald's of the hot dog business.  They do everything well, but don't do anything great.  However, if you're looking for a good hot dog and a relaxing dining experience, this is a great place for you.  It doesn't have the cache of a Pink's, but then it also doesn't have the lines associated with a Pink's.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:23:52Z","yelp_user_id":"xhlQ_3bQREHqTTImfC457g"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:07:59Z","date":"2009-08-27","review_id":"pHA6qMM9PK4j8Il_Z0yaiA","stars":2,"text":"Tried out the Stand on a whim. And now I don't want to go back.\n\nI ordered the Stand Brat with chips. Drink was water. Should be pretty straightforward. But the prep time for a sausage in a hot dog bun took a long time. My friend who ordered a burger and fries about the same time was served first. And then I kept waiting. The restaurant wasn't very busy, and the kitchen seemed to be staffed with at least 4 people. But I just kept on waiting. When I finally got it, they gave me it in a to-go box even though I never said to-go.\n\nThe food itself was not horrid, about what I was expecting. But for the price and service, it's not worth it. Here's the big issue, which I haven't even gotten into yet. They give the customers pagers when upon ordering. This suggests the customers go pick up their own food. Okay. But then for whatever reason, they decide to do table service. Why have pagers then? Why not switch to numbers at the table? And the waiters have no clue what table to serve the food, aimlessly wandering the dining area. Is it this table? No. That table? No. That's something out of a Kitchen Nightmares episode.\n\nSo no, I do not plan on coming back. I think the concept could totally work in the Westwood Village area, but the Stand needs to get its act together.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:40:12Z","yelp_user_id":"SpGoNeZ9uMBNpeW4i-b9tg"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:31:18Z","date":"2011-07-31","review_id":"PJxexNTAdikLqCBMS5P-AQ","stars":3,"text":"This is pretty good for what it is--hot dogs and hamburgers.

Their buns are always hard and the dogs are not as tasty or flavorful as Great LA landmarks like PINK'S.

My friend smiled at the kitchen who looked surprised to see us and yelled \"CUSTOMER\" to the back. A server then showed up. \n\nWe both ordered burgers and the server suggested we try a turkey burger on a wheat bun. I decided to try it out while my friend got the Big Blue Burger with fries and a Stella. I went a healthier route since I was already doing a Turkey Burger on Wheat bun. I asked if I can get a salad with that since most place gladly substitute salad for like $1 more. They said I couldn't and it's $4 for a small dinner salad. They said I should try the The Stand Ale they had on Special so I did. The meal came out to like $30. \n\nAn interesting feature is you can see the food being made in the kitchen through a pixie glass like an In N Out burger Drive thru. We sat at a table across from the kitchen but my friend wanted to move soon after because the kitchen keep waiving at her and smiling like if there never seen a women before. Talk about uncomfortable. My friend asked the server there and she said that the kitchen is pretty bad about that kind of thing and how she even hates being left alone with them.

My friend was enjoying her Stella as I wasn't that pleased with the The Stand Ale. It tasted like a bad mouth wash to tell you the truth. \n\nMy friends burger looked good although she didn't care for the fries. She said they were super hard. My turkey Burger kept deteriorating cause of the weak wheat burger bun. The worst part was my salad was browning and wilting. The saddest salad I EVER have eaten.

The Cashier said they are no longer serving that item, yet it was still displayed on the menu.

After waiting about 10-15 minutes, the owner, who was entertaining some friends, came over and asked the family what they ordered and to see what was wrong.  Apparently the kids were getting cranky because of hunger.  Hmmm... so were we.\nThe owner found out that the order didn't make it to the kitchen and got their food going immediately and brought them cookies to tide the kids over.\n\nWe kept on waiting.\n\nSeveral more couples and groups came in and sat down.  I'd say three groups of tables received their food BEFORE us, so I knew they were fast at making burgers.  The entire staff started flitting around trying to figure out why certain orders weren't making it to the kitchen.  Not one time did anyone ask us if we were all right since it was coming on 20 minutes.  Finally I said something and they figured out we were also on the sh*t list.  They hastily listened to my order again and I went to sit down.\n\nFinally the food came.\n\nWe had ordered two mushroom turkey burgers.  Mine had a wheat bun, avocado and chips.  Eric ordered a plain bun with chips.\n\nWhat we got were two regular burgers on plain buns, one with chips and the other with fries.\n\nWe said we didn't get what we ordered and they apologized for their computer system and that it was the third day of business, but not for putting in the wrong order.  They gave me my money back in cash but I realized I stupidly gave them a tip on the credit card receipt, so I didn't get that back.\n\nWhat drove the terrible experience home for me is that the staff and owner were going around to all of the tables to make sure customers were getting their food and that they were having an enjoyable experience... even the guy sweeping up the floor was asking customers!  Not once did they come to our table!!!!  The sweeper asked the table next to us, passed us over and went to another table.  \n\nSo we left.  We took our money and coupon for two free burgers and walked out the door.\n\nI think it would take a miracle to get Eric to go back there.  And hopefully they have a good IT manager to rely on.\n\nProps for a good menu, fast service when computers are working, decent staff when things are going right\n\nCons for staff members rushing to make orders instead of listening properly for the correct order, ignoring us","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:39:43Z","yelp_user_id":"WbKjWmre98UEhy-xnPrhAQ"},{"business_id":"_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:30:26Z","date":"2011-07-03","review_id":"tw0VoiZV6bej_8UTuz-sYg","stars":4,"text":"This is a good place if you're craving a burger.

I desperately wish there was something like Top Dog around Berkeley in Westwood. The Stand certainly looks impressive from the decor, but the food is absolutely repulsive. \n\nFood: I tried the \"Loaded\" Stand dog (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VyR84b3N4OnpH2U53D1xJQ?select=tyrESk8AuBQx8htfHX8Q3g) and the Downtown LA dog (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VyR84b3N4OnpH2U53D1xJQ?select=bIZuSw1rFky5X91RqvS6Cw). Neither were as tantalizing as the description made them sound, primarily because they were drenched in mayo or substandard toppings. The \"Loaded\" Stand dog has several options for toppings and it doesn't cost you extra to order them all, which is basically what I did. Big mistake. Bell peppers are good alone. Sweet relish is good alone. Onions are good with bell peppers. But add everything together and it's disasterous. The Downtown LA dog is probably trying to mimic a Dodger dog, but it's covered in low quality mayo and mustard that make eating it a soggy and unappetizing experience. Not even the chips were good; they were overly fried and tasteless. I felt so bad throwing it away... so wasteful. \n\nAtmosphere: This is the one saving aspect of The Stand. The inside is decorated with a 50s theme, very retro chic. The walls are plastered with giant advertisements for each of the different hot dogs so that you can't help but salivate once you enter. They did a really good job with the design here. \n\nService: I ordered from the cash register and ate my stuff at home. Nothing unusual to report here. \n\nSynopsis: At ~$4.50 per dog, The Stand is not a bad deal but still not as great as the former Udog.

Awful. \n\nI'd been eyeing this place since it opened and had high expectations. They used to have three signs over top of the store, advertising that they were an all you can eat sushi, Chinese, and Mongolian grill buffet. Personally, all I saw was Chinese, and the only sign they have left says \"Tokyo sushi\". It was hard to figure out exactly what the place was called; everyone around where I live calls it \"that Chinese place by the movie theatre\", and I swear I've seen signs with various names for it all around the area. \n\nI was very excited when I grabbed my plate though. Personally, my favorite Chinese appetizer is crab rangoon, so I grabbed a bunch, along with a some sweet and sour sauce, a spring roll and chicken on a stick. The crab rangoon looked funny when I broke it open...but I was hungry so I dove in anyways. If not for the sweet and sour sauce, it would have tasted like cream cheese with a bit of onion powder mixed in-- shameful, I tell you. To mess up crab rangoon, you've committed a great sin. The spring roll tasted like nothing, so I drowned it in soy sauce. The chicken on a stick was fine, flavorless, but fine, though I'm not too sure how possible it is to mess that up. \n\nI went back for more, despite being turned off by my first plate. I was going to get my money's worth either way. Despite being called \"Tokyo Sushi\", there sure wasn't much of that. There was some itty bitty california rolls and shrimp tempura rolls, but the rice was hard and they weren't very good. I'm not sure if sushi is more prominent during lunch, but with a look at their menu, it's expensive as hell anyways. I'm talking 15 bucks for a specialty roll order. I could go to Bethesda for sushi twice the quality at half the price, according to a fellow sushi enthusiast. \n\nI took a few rolls anyways, with some general tso's chicken and white rice. I could tell by looking at the rice that it was overcooked, and when I tasted it, I knew I should have trusted my instincts. The general tsos was soggy, like it'd been left there all day, and again, tasted like nothing. \n\nBy that point, my friend and I were grumbling about the crappiness of the food but were still hungry, so we went for salad and fruit. Not trusting the ranch dressing, I had my salad with warm italian dressing, and was again turned off. I recall my friend joking and remarking \"They can't mess up watermelon, can they?\" and then spitting it out saying it was warm and dry. \n\nPerhaps my standards are too high because I'm an asian cuisine fanatic, and can make most of their selections at home by myself. But If I, an amateur, can make it a hundred times better, then I might as well have saved the money and done just that. I mean, even the orange crush I ordered tasted watered down. I'm giving this place two stars, because the waitress was very sweet, but I really recommend fellow yelpers to save themselves a night of food poisoning and get their fill of Chinese food elsewhere.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:18:46Z","yelp_user_id":"LeekeS6XmRaTsy0wozCfyg"},{"business_id":"_fT1huneKpDiFZoNrLaFDA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:07:40Z","date":"2012-07-08","review_id":"9_vvBBkSCeunfevNRW22Mg","stars":5,"text":"I do not understand the hate that this place gets.

When I gave you exact change for my beer, you stood there and stared me down, until, uncomfortable, I asked if I had the correct amount. You said, in reply, THANKS A LOT, apparently not noticing, in my other hand, the dollar I was about to put down on the bar as a tip. \n\nYou see, in all of my years frequenting bars, I've never given my tip in the same wad of cash as I use to pay for my drink, because it seems easier for the bartender to tell that they don''t need to make change if I leave it on the bar separately. And friends of mine who have tended bar have done the same. In fact, I copied this technique from someone who tends bar. \n\nAlso, you didn't pour my beer. The nice guy working with you did. It was for him that I still put down the dollar tip, on a three dollar beer. For you, I could only muster a look of shock, because I've never been treated that way before in a bar. \n\nI stood there for a moment, hurt, wanting to say something back, but I didn't, because I'm generally the kind of conflict-adverse person who is so eager to please that I tip more than I should most of the time. \n\nMaking me feel that awful and confused means if you ever serve me again, I will not be tipping.

I am totally against DUI.\n\nI am not an alcohol person. My typical drinks are Gin Tonic, Margarita or the recently acquired Midori Sour. I went for the Midori Sour but they ran out of whatever that made it and said they had blue or whatever-I-couldn't-hear Sour. I went for the Blue Sour. Imagine walking back with a blue drink to a table of macho guys who were into martial arts and drinking brown beer...\n\nAnyway overall I had fun (guessed the alcohol totally kicked in) and the game was actually enjoyable (not so bloody in the end). The decor was like a regular dive bar and music was not loud so you could have a conversation. The drink was inexpensive too, $4 for a cocktail.
