I ordered online and submitted pay with credit card, but they didn't get my info online. I immediately called, despite not being prompted, and they ran it over the phone, just want you to be aware of this because I personally don't like when delivery people take my card imprint. Also, when the delivery man came evidently he chose not to call my cell even though my number was on the order, and so my boyfriend who was sick could not answer our apartment line, I guess after a while, he finally decided to pick up our apartment line and get the food, and the delivery guy started yelling at him.

It was by far the most expensive clothing purchase I have ever made (aside from a couple of suits), and as a graduate student I do not have a lot of money to throw around. I bought it specifically for upcoming interviews and was very excited to have it. My tailor told me to have it pressed before wearing it and he gave me specific instructions to tell the cleaners. I decided to go the Ye olde cleaning shop because it is close to where I live. \n\nSo I brought the shirt and and gave them the instructions as communicated to me by the tailor. I received the pink return slip and all seemed well. I picked up the shirt a couple of days later and cheerfully brought it to my apartment to try it on. Uh oh.  There was a small but extremely noticeable dark black mark on the left front breast of the shirt. It was as if someone had taken a pen and rubbed it a few cm.. in either direction. I had that sinking feeling in my stomach because this shirt was suddenly no longer interview worthy. \n\nI immediately returned the cleaners and very nicely suggested to the man behind that counter, who had helped me both at drop off and pickup, that perhaps something had gone wrong in the cleaning process. I explained that it was a brand new shirt, never worn outside of my tailors shop. In fact I had taken it directly out of the tailor's box and handed it to the dry cleaners. I told him that it was a custom shirt and very important to me. \n\nIn response, the man behind the counter hardly said a word, but rather took the shirt, examined the mark, and stated, \"That's not a pen mark.\" Then, he ran up something in the computer, gave me a slip and somewhat harshly exclaimed, \"three days.\" \n\nNow at this point I should have grabbed the shirt back and gotten out of there. Any establishment that will stain your garment, and then seem annoyed that you brought it to their attention, should be avoided. And i knew it then. but I thought that maybe they could fix the stain. Heck they are a dry cleaners right? \n\nSo three days later I show up, and the same man tells me the shirt is \"on it's way,\" but hasn't arrived yet. Ok. Fine. So I leave, and come back the next day. The same man searches for the shirt for a few minutes, and guess what, he can't find it. He looks bewildered. He tells me to give him my phone number and he'll call me. At this point, I'm still acting extremely polite because I really want it all to work out, as the dry cleaners is so close. Of course, hours later, I still hadn't received a call. So I call them. And this time a lady picks up and tells me she found it. Great! \n\nSo I go down the next day to pick up the shirt, but again the guy can't find it. Pretty ridiculous. So same thing over again. I call later that evening and the woman tells me it is definitely there.The next day I go back and indeed, this time, it's there. I take it back to my apartment and check it out. Quite unhappily, the stain is still in the breast pocket, but now there's a new addition to my interview shirt: red stains all over the cuffs! \n\nAt this point I'm quite frustrated and bring the shirt back to show them what's happened The guy hardly says a word, sort of smirks when I explain that I have to bring it to another dry cleaners to try and fix the damage they have done, and then merely offers to try and fix it again. ha! Fooled me once! \n\nI never received an apology, or an offer of reimbursement for another dry cleaners. The other dry cleaners I brought it to has been unable to remove the stains. Ye Olde cleaning shop stained my shirt and did so with little remorse. \n\nIf you have any interest in your clothes, steer clear of this place.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:07:23Z","yelp_user_id":"17oW4FLV1qr7q_eU6l3zKw"},{"business_id":"Yi6PBCMivXha8AkKb6wnsw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:35:29Z","date":"2011-06-25","review_id":"Ox21LcLknEoAl1KQPlV0pw","stars":1,"text":"The customer service was terrible!

My boyfriend and I are Tasti-D-Lite people, but I wanted to give this place a try.  I'd read a review about it a few years back.  So one night, I convince my boyfriend that we should go here.  We will never go back.  \n\nFor starters, it's pretentious.  The whole decor pissed him off.  It didn't bother me so much except for the workers' attitudes that went along with it. \n\nFirst there is a line, with one worker ringing you up and then another line to the other worker delving out the fro-yo.  The prices are high.  A small is $5 and it is small (smaller than Tasti-D-Lite small at least).  Toppings are about $1 each.  After we got past the first line and finished paying, we went to the second line.  There they had a small sign that students get a discount.  Hmmm, that might have been more helpful if we could have seen it from the register - guess that's the scam, make you come back a second time for a discount - not going to happen.  \n\nOk, now we've paid, but the pretentiousness continues.  The person serving up the fro-yo pours some in a cup, and then uses a small scale to weigh it.  Give me a break!  (1) You're wasting time people are waiting for their ice cream; (2) unless you're charging us by the ounce, I think eyeballing it is good enough.  It's like, they want to make sure that you don't get more than an ounce of a small.  More likely, they only have one size cup and want to differentiate between small, mediums and larges.  Either way, don't weight my f*(&)(*& ice cream.  \n\nI hope I've stressed how this whole 2 line process, which includes a machine in the back that prints up your order for the second person and then the whole thing getting weighed, takes time.  More time than getting frozen yogurt should take.  Tasti-D-Lite, with their one person doing everything is much more efficient.  \n\nHow does the stuff taste?

Secondly you would think that raspberries were going extinct: one raspberry on the entire thing? And you should have seen the girls face when I told her I would like more. The kiwi was watery and diluted the entire FroYo and the strawberries were nowhere near fresh. \n\nThe one thing that bothered me the most, though, was the cashier system. You basically pay before you get your FroYo so by the time I got to the counter, the server just said nonchalantly \"Sorry Ma'am, the coconut machine is broken.\" Now when I ordered at the cashier, I ordered mango and coconut, like I always do. But this time was different. He actually charged me 50 cents for the coconut and 50 cents more for the mango. Basically a dollar more than every other time AND I didn't even get my coconut. \n\nThe place is crowded, hot, and filled with annoying couples on dates.

Much better quality meat than the overpriced taco truck on 96th Street.   I might be able to stay in New York indefinitely now since California is going bankrupt.  Thank you Taqueria y Fonda.

The carne asada taco was a tad dry, but decent.  The chicken tamale was moist and flavorful, but I was never a big fan of chicken tamales, so I am a poor judge on that one.  The carnitas giant burrito was a pretty big disappointment.  It was bland and only upon finishing did I realize that there wasn't any sour cream or guacamole in that huge burrito that was the size of a newborn baby!

And pico de gallo is not salsa.)\n\nThe basics are what matters in Mexican food: beans, rice, tortillas, salsa, chips. A good Mexican restaurant ALWAYS makes its own chips, served fresh, and always makes its own salsa/hot sauce.  Taqueria y Fonda gets this right. Tortillas are heated on a griddle so there are delicious dark spots and no gumminess. Chips are fresh, salsa is hot but with depth of flavor, beans and rice are consistent and well seasoned. \n\nMy favorites: chorizo or carnitas tacos - tasty pork!, cheese and jalepeno tamales, enchiladas verdes, carne enchiladas, chips, rice & beans.\n\nNot so much: the popular giant burritos (I like to be able to pick up a burrito in my hands, and these are wrapped loosely and overstuffed with less expensive ingredients.

I should say, at this point, that I grew up on the west coast, so I know what good Mexican should taste like, and I knew that a place like this would probably be my best bet. Well anyway, the food was not good. I still wanted to believe, though! I've been to this place probably 5-6 times over the years, every time thinking \"this can't be as bad as I remembered it\". It is. So this morning, I got a hankering for huevos rancheros, and since they are still the most authentic place that delivers to my house, I decided to go for it again. Big mistake. Over an hour later, I had a fairly soggy bunch of huevos. Clearly I should have gone with the egg and cheese bagel instead.\n\nWhat's wrong? Well, nothing really has much flavor--it's all kind of bland. If you do feel like you need to go for one of their enormous burritos, you won't finish it and you'll feel horrible from eating all those carbs. There might be a little meat too, but you won't taste it. Even their guacamole doesn't taste good--I don't know how, but they've managed flavorless guacamole. Now I know that I probably had it coming with the breakfast I ordered today--not a big surprise that it would be a bit soggy after delivery. Still, it was pretty disappointing. I was also forced to get a carnitas taco to push it up to $10 (why are their tacos $3?) . Again, flavorless, and I didn't notice much of the green sauce I selected.\n\nDo yourself a favor and look up La Aguila on either 103rd or 116th and Lexington. SO MUCH BETTER. Unfortunately I'm a bit out of their delivery range.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:29:27Z","yelp_user_id":"u2s8xy6ah1ejA42svNNpmw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:22:19Z","date":"2010-05-30","review_id":"c2ro1hBIFB6Q1PFImaoqJw","stars":4,"text":"I love this place.

Yeah it's waaay uptown, but no matter.  I'LL BE BACK.\n\nA good sign that you are in a great Mexican restaurant is the chips.  The chips and salsa set up at Taqueria y Fonda impressed me immediately.  They don't give you any store-bought or wimpy, thin chips.  They don't give you mediocre salsa.  At Taqueria y Fonda you will get a modest bowl of thick, tasty homemade tortilla chips and three different salsas as soon as you are seated at a table.

They are spicy and fresh and flavorful and they offer plenty of all.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the cheese enchiladas with mole sauce.  This plate was something to be reckoned with.  Their cheese enchiladas are filled with some very fresh-tasting Oaxaca cheese and they are very, very generous with that cheese.  And they don't give you two tiny enchiladas -- you get three huge enchiladas that span the length of the plate!  The mole sauce I tried with the enchiladas was amazing.  AMAZING.  The sauce, straight up, is a work of art.  It's definitely the thickest mole sauce I've experienced, but what I liked about it was that the chocolate flavor was very bold and was balanced perfectly with the spiciness of the chilis and the complexity of all the other millions of spices they put in there.  And it tasted fresh, like they had just made it a few hours before.   Even the black refried beans and the yellow rice they served with the plate were awesome.  Usually the beans and rice that come with a plate are just kind of \"eh, whatever\", but the rice and beans here were soooo good.  I ate them all!  And I appreciated getting a fresh green salad with the meal too.\n\nI can't wait to go back to Taqueria y Fonda and try their tacos, burritos, and other goodness.  I'm sure it's going to be just as good and I really am so excited to have found some Mexican food that rivals all that I used to have in California.  Plus, the people that work here are nice.  They do acknowledge and seat you right away (when you don't have to wait for a table) and they offer expedient, polite waiter service and a good selection of Mexican beers.  Now, I only wish they'd create a downtown location!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:44:14Z","yelp_user_id":"MnqUg0xKRmytKhMjH3Mi7A"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:54:22Z","date":"2009-01-01","review_id":"eSvtm8QLPbDVCKKoPbsi4A","stars":5,"text":"The huge chicken burritos are my favorite.

But I walked by it today and was happy to find it open.  Cool.  \n\nI stepped in and ordered three tacos - al pastor, chorizo, and lengua.  I was given a bowl of chips and three salsas.  The chips were alright.  Feeling kind of homemade but lacking a little something.  But yards better than Tostitos or some crap.  There were two green salsas, one a little garlicky (?) and one more straight up pureed.  The red salsa was a little creamy (?) and had a slightly off taste.  Anyway, the green salsas were pretty good.\n\nThe tacos were $3.75 each with a $.75 surcharge for guac or cheese.  I got guac on all three.  Well, actually, I got a little thing of guac on the side which cost me $2.25.  Besides that, the guac was really forgettable.  Not worth it.  Anyway, the point is that this was an expensive three-taco lunch.\n\nThe portions, however, are quite large, somewhat compensating for the relatively high prices.  The downside of large portions, however, was that the tacos tended to fall apart and the garnishes got lost in the mass of meat.  I don't know if I've just been accustomed to having my tatsebuds shocked by Chipolte or whatever, but the meat seemed underseasoned.  Even the chorizo, which really should taste pretty strongly, was a bit bland.  And bland meat in large quantities lends to bland tacos. \n\nI'd come back here again, but I think they'd be better off with slightly smaller portions and, accordingly, slightly lower prices.  I want to try the mole sauce sometime soon.  And they should work on the guacamole.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:46:42Z","yelp_user_id":"Bn5MMY_TxO3JD7fped20Yw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:55:08Z","date":"2010-08-09","review_id":"F-qigZn6odOrgQIPV8ZzdA","stars":4,"text":"3.5 stars, rounded up for the benefit of the doubt.\n\nShort story: The tacos here are legit enough to qualify, in my eyes, as Mexican, and while there are better places in the city, I could easily see this place as being an apropos late-night destination...and goodness, those burritos were mighty swole!\n\nLong story (complete with dissection of said tacos):\n- Short primer on judging Mexican food: Yes, good, authentic food is difficult to find in general in the US.  The only areas I've been particularly impressed with are the southern borders of Texas--near my hometown--and California, mainly in the San Ysidro/south SD area (Greater LA and the Bay Area have their pockets, but I've never been floored in either locale).  Everywhere else is hit-or-miss, so I never approach a place with any real amount of hope unless I'm back home, where Yelp doesn't even exist yet.\n\nIgnore all the comments about dingy hole-in-the-wall whatnot.  Either my threshold for cleanliness is extremely low or this place seemed perfectly fine.  I ordered two tacos al pastor and one of carne asada.  I know this place gets a lot of fame for its burritos, but since a burrito is not a genuine Mexican concoction, ordering one would preclude me from rating this place fairly.\n\nThe tortillas were white corn, not homemade but correctly doubled-up, as they should be.  I prefer smaller, yellow corn tortillas to be a bit more true to my roots, but I can go with it.  The filling was good for the most part: chopped tomato (not too common in Mexican taqueria-style tacos), both chopped and grilled onion (though the latter was sliced too big and, thus, not properly caramelized), and a hint of cilantro, though I was longing for much more.  All three of the salsas were tasty, though none was particularly hot.  The carne asada was fairly tender, but otherwise could use much more spice and salt.  The pork in the al pastor had too much of the pineapple in the marinade and not enough of the various chiles and other flavors, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, this place is about the most authentic that I've been to in Manhattan, but a bit of searching and traveling to the other boroughs should take you to more representative establishments should you desire something a step above the quick and easy.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:00:29Z","yelp_user_id":"bQu8WeTqtF4NMXKWD8O8Cw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:38:56Z","date":"2007-02-13","review_id":"fEmzipRUCtFIHbgMTpJJgw","stars":4,"text":"Of the Mexican places I've been in New York, this is the best.

This is available in unlimited quantities (along with two other types of salsa) for dine in guests, but they are curiously stingy about giving you more than one little container of it for take out orders.\n\nThe food here is hit or miss, I've tried a lot here, and some things are very good, and some things are quite bad.

It's delicious and filling.\n\nI usually end up getting the quesadilla, as for me it is the right balance of substance and price (note: not the kind of quesadilla you'd pick up and eat, it's covered with stuff which requires you to fork and knife it).\n\nI've had the burrito for takeout, ans sometimes it's preferable to Chipotle's for me. Not easy to eat though.\n\nThey have all different kinds of meat for the more adventurous...

Even stepping inside to see the modest takeout counter, the handful of tables, and the beer/ soda-filled refrigerator in the back doesn't reveal anything out of the ordinary.\n\nIf you start with chips w/ salsa, you do start to suspect something is up.  These are the thick earthy tortilla chips that you don't find at most places - especially hole in the walls.  Even more suspicious, three salsas are provided and none of them are pico de gallo - a spicy red, a green tomatillo, and a creamy but spicy salsa verde.  All three are very good but I found myself going to the green ones over the red.\n\nIt was only when my taco ($3) and quesadilla ($4.50) arrived that I realize what this place's true superpower is - the ability to supersize the meat in Mexican dishes.  My carnitas (pork) taco was gi-grande.  The roasted pork was served in nice sized chunks and overflowed from my two soft tortilla shells everytime I picked it up for a bite.  It honestly has more meat than you usually get in 2 tacos...  \n\nSimilarly, my chicken quesadilla - usually a dish I find provides too much cheese compared to meat - is the opposite.  This barely resembed a quesadilla - it was more like a rolled taco with lettuce, tomato, and small amounts of avocado and grated cheese over a tortilla shell filled with a lot of grilled chicken and a little bit of melted cheese.\n\nMy take on both the taco and quesadilla is the same.  I enjoyed the clean flavors and great value of each but feel like their superpower (huge portions of meat) needed a counterbalance.  Don't get me wrong - I loved the pork and chicken but really could've used some sweetness (maybe pineapple in the pork taco?) or something sharp (more grated cheese?).  Maybe if the meat was spiced more?  Even with adding salsa, I just found the meat in both dishes somewhat out of ratio with the tortilla and other ingredients leading to a bit of taste monotony. \n\nSo I'd give this 5 stars for value but 4 stars on overall taste.  For now, I'll round down to 4 stars - maybe after I try out one of their entrees, I'll mark it up.  Consider it 5 stars if you're a huge meat fan (or on a tight budget)...I'd still recommend the Super Tacos truck on 96th street for a more satisfying, balanced taco....","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:36:22Z","yelp_user_id":"YXMiSBrLNcnbxnfMK4BVug"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:20:09Z","date":"2011-02-05","review_id":"JaJ67oj1urKAqqaLl7nUUQ","stars":2,"text":"Just because a place is a hole in the wall doesn't mean that it's good. \n\nJust because food is authentic doesn't mean that it's good. \n\nA lot of Yelpers seem to cite these qualities in Taqueria's favor, but it doesn't work for me. I could go to Mexico and find hole-in-the-wall, crappy, authentic food, but that doesn't mean it deserves any more than two stars.\n\nI've eaten here several times and the food is underwhelming. It's not bad, but it tastes like the effort someone who has been in a dead-end job for twenty years and knows it puts into his work - tired and disinterested. \n\nThe giant burrito, Taqueria's big gimmick, is similarly overrated. True to its name, it's a very big burrito, but the flavors don't come together very well and the rice and beans don't cut the avocado. Size matters, but not in this case. Maybe it would work better as a burrito bowl. One of the few things New York's culinary landscape lacks is a good burrito. If any Yelpers know of one in the city, please pass along!\n\nTaqueria's only saving grace is its torta, which is really good and the only reason I keep coming back. You get meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno and avocado all on a bollilo roll. The jalapeno provides the sandwich with the necessary heat and the meat, beans and cheese, when squeezed tightly between the split halves of the roll, come together in a way that escapes the unwieldy burrito. On top of that it's well-priced and almost large enough for two meals.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood and your only criteria for Mexican food is authenticity, then maybe Taqueria will suit you fine. However, if you want good authentic Mexican food, then I'd recommend the taco truck (Super Tacos) on 96th, which, except for the torta, is a lot better.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:57:02Z","yelp_user_id":"yVR1d-TDPugjeJNMrky_NQ"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:18:21Z","date":"2010-10-29","review_id":"jsLJab6bB22gat6CyOs_2w","stars":4,"text":"I could eat here every day for lunch and be happy.

Not even in Mexico (and I was actually in real Mexico. Not resort Mexico).\n\nThe thing I really, really love about Taqueria is that it is actually two restaurants in one. The first is a hole-in-the-wall taqueria where you can get a $5 taco which comes with three tortillas and, with the free chips, is definitely enough for a meal. Although I always order a tamale with it, because I love their tamales. Still, altogether that's still under $10 for a really filling, really tasty and authentic Mexican meal.\n\nThe second Taqueria is the one serving daily specials on a par with the dishes at places like Rosa Mexicana, like chicken mole, fresh fish, and seafood enchiladas in chile verde sauce. These dishes are a bit pricier at $10 -  $15, but, like the tacos, burritos, and tortas, are amazingly tasty and authentic. So no matter what kind of meal you're in the mood for, whether taqueria- or full-on restaurant-style, this place has got you covered.\n\nNow, be aware that Taqueria manages to offer its amazing prices by keeping its overhead low-- they keep the decor and the dining experience basic. We're talking plastic tables and chairs, a tiny TV playing loud South American soccer games in the background, and tables so close to the grill that you walk out with your clothes infused with the smoky smell of the churrasco you just ate. (They'll continue to smell that way until you wash them). They recently expanded into the store next door, so now they have two dining rooms, only one of which contains the grill. But it's still very, very basic. I suspect the owning family handles the service, since we are often served drinks by an adorable eight-year-old. Sometimes the service is great. Other times they're slammed and have trouble keeping up. But they are ALWAYS friendly, which excuses a lot in my book.\n\nI can't comment on the reviews that complain about incorrect orders, since I've never had a problem with mine. Taqueria seems to be getting more popular by the day, so my guess is that they're in the process of working out some kinks related to that, like how many staff members they actually need and such.\n\nBottom line: EAT HERE. It is likely to be the tastiest, most authentic Mexican food you will ever eat and you will not pay an arm and a leg for it.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:49:53Z","yelp_user_id":"7QdYcBgFgMuJNpexrovc6Q"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:50:47Z","date":"2009-07-03","review_id":"Qviqnqgtox9UeF68JOgU3w","stars":2,"text":"Okay. Taquiera is a tough call. Of course you've already heard about the dirt and grime everywhere, the lack of space, the dimness, the squeakiness, push-shoviness, elbow-to-elbow set-up. That's all fine. Just be aware that this hole in the wall serves food appropriate for a hole in the wall. If you're not sure what that means, read on.\n\nWhat makes this place hard to review for me is that everything they serve is good as long as it's not green. The chips to start the meal arrive a little bit warm; I liked all three of the salsas, not particularly the watery avocado but the really interesting, darker-green one and the spicy red sauce. Still, it's great to get to sample all three.\n\nLooking at the menu (trying not to touch it--it's possibly the most oily piece of laminated paper I've ever got my hands on), you won't find a single green thing on it besides three barely-noticeable salads. I jumped for the house salad and the chicken torta (sandwich).\n\nThe place is run by two people: a cashier/server and a cook. Both are friendly; neither speaks much English. As this place was packed soon after I came in at 12:45, I had to wait quite a bit for just the salad, which was thoroughly unimpressive. Big, yes, but just totally boring and relatively tasteless. None of the ingredients seemed fresh.\n\nI finished the chips and waited for the torta, which was well worth it. It came all alone on a plate; I was glad to have ordered a salad, all things considered. The torta was really unique: a huge jumble of chicken, guacamole, cheese, tomato, lettuce, avocado, jalape\u00f1o, all on the Mexican equivalent of a Kaiser roll: bolillo bread. I was full halfway into this sandwich; it's enormous. But again, enormous doesn't mean good. In this case, I thought the torta was good, but really grimy and greasy.\n\nIn this sense, Taqueria serves authentic Mexican, but the quality of the ingredients and the jumble of ingredients makes for food that tastes like it should come from a street vendor or lunch van. That's not to say it's bad, but it is greasier and grimier than I would have liked.\n\nI won't be going back to Taqueria; the food is good, but good in only a certain way. I can see why there is so much reverence for this place; the type of food served here, however, just isn't my type. In the end, this hole in the wall serves food appropriate for a hole in the wall--honest, yes, but a little much.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is that the $ price rating for this place is wrong. If you want a balanced lunch, you'll end up paying $14 with tip. There is no option for a side salad, and each dish is very bare-bones. (My sandwich looked out of place on a plate; it would be at home in a brown bag.)","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:49:08Z","yelp_user_id":"ReqtBDNMerD2O4_34KOqcw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:48:09Z","date":"2012-04-18","review_id":"r3d-8nUaok8pelUSs3yFRA","stars":3,"text":"Great burrito, very very big.

I think the turnover rate is more important than the quality. \n\nI had the chicken chipotle burrito, which was really big.  In comparison to the Chipotle fast food chain, this is a much better alternative for the value.  It was $10.95.  I had 2 Tecate bottles of beer, which were $4 each.  That to me, in this atmosphere, was just far too pricey.  Taqueria Y La Fonda is a hole in the wall.  I wouldn't mind paying $2.50 for a beer here, but $4 is a little too excessive for a hole in the wall.  Anyway, opinionated price points aside, the service lacked attention.   Again, they are just far too busy it seems. \n\nThey give you 3 salsa's and some chips.  The chips are homemade so they're crunchy and fresh, but they lack zing.  The sauces are great.  I used them in my burrito.  I've only been once so I'm not sure which is the hottest, but we suspect that it's the toxic neon green looking one.  Maybe not. \n\nI also had the chorizo taco, which was also ok.  It had a TON of onions, so if you don't like onions make sure that you tell them, when ordering, to hold off on them, otherwise you will spend half of your time picking the onions out before giving up and just devouring the thing.  Bland tortillas and overkill on the onions aside, the actual chorizo was quite tasty. \n\nAll in all I know I doubt I will come back here, although I may order in once, but I doubt it.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:37:21Z","yelp_user_id":"oSq0NKO2x_DEllpua-xgrQ"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:38:43Z","date":"2010-04-06","review_id":"RHe-3OX1mnl2yXBx2oB6fg","stars":2,"text":"Tried to use a Restaurant.com gift certificate here but was unsuccessful.

The food here only gets two stars from me. I ordered a veggie burrito with a side of guacamole today and both items were really liquidy. Any fan of real Mexican food knows that guacamole should be thick and creamy, not watery, and it shouldn't have such a high proportion of onions to avocado. More than half of this container is filled with chopped onions! Not cool. And as soon as I unwrapped my burrito, liquid came gushing out of it and it looked like it was going for a swim.

But wait! This isn't your standard Californian in NY burrito bitchfest. I think this place is actually pretty good, but it's true their burritos suck /compared to what I'm expecting/.\n\nLet me explain, but first let me list out the good and bad, according to me:\nGOOD:\n- Carnitas meat - just fatty enough, could have been grilled a little longer but this is typical of true blue Mexican carnitas. (My preferred carnitas are the El Salvadorean crispy style.)\n- Chips - They have a good crunch and a nice airy center. If anything they could be a little bit thinner.\n- Salsa - take a miss on the red one and the radioactive green one, but don't get your hands off the other green one. Shit is tasty.\n\nBAD:\n- The burrito seemed to have been wrapped more competently than I've seen around here, but it was also the size of a land mine so there's no point picking it up anyway.\n- Not enough pico de gallo in the burrito.\n- Not enough sour cream in the burrito.\n- No salsa was spicy enough to even register on my burn-o-meter.\n- Salad leaves were way too huge, it felt like I was eating a torta instead of a burrito.\n- Mozzarella cheese? Weird.\n- Only black beans available. No refried.\n\nNow just because I've mentioned some bad things, I'm not blaming them for those things, expecting them to be fixed next time I show up. \n\nThe first thing to remember about burritos is that they are NOT originally Mexican. They are most famously a California thing. It's easy to assume that when you have a lousy burrito here in NYC, the reason is that they are not actually Mexican, but some imitation latinos making Mexican food, but this is flawed logic. I am pretty sure the peeps here are truly Mexican and it shows in the way they cook their meats.\n\nPlus, not all Mexicans come to the US through California. Far from it. If the Mexicans in California make burritos a certain way, it's because they learned how to make it from their friends in California -- remember, not a native dish. So the California burrito is a geographically limited specialty.\n\nIf these guys came here through, say, Texas, and then up to New York, decided to start a restaurant, and realized that everyone wanted these ridiculous burrito things, you would make them based on how they sounded and how similar burritos tasted in the area, then check it off the list of \"things people want which should be on the menu even though I have no attachment to them.\"\n\n\"Okay, so apparently you take a huge flour tortilla and smoosh some beans, rice, guacamole, and meat into it. These gringos love the stuff!\"\n\"Anything else I should know?\"\n\"Well, all the ones I tried were big.. so let's make ours BIGGER! USA! USA!\"\n\"I love it! What else?\"\n\"There was cheese inside too. Let's stand out by having a different cheese, like.. mozzarella!\"\n\"Great! That sounds like a real winner!\"\n\n... And it probably was, because this fits into the concept of the \"NYC\" burrito. If you don't compare it to a California burrito, to be honest it's not a bad dish.\n\nLong story short? The way I see it, unless the people are Mexicans who learned how to make [insert pseudo-Mexican dish] in [insert American region], there is no point expecting an [insert American region] [insert pseudo-Mexican dish].\n\nSo you're only fooling yourself if you call [insert American region] [insert pseudo-Mexican dish] \"authentic Mexican food.\" Cause it ain't.\n\nInstead, what you should do is focus on the traditional dishes that they grew up with in the old country and really know how to cook because you'll only be disappointed with their version of a [insert pseudo-Mexican dish].\n\nAnd that's exactly what I shall do next time I return to Taqueria y La Fonda Mexicana, then post another review!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:51:01Z","yelp_user_id":"Lb37hatAjI3fgHEh2lMNEw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:26:34Z","date":"2011-08-30","review_id":"SPvhgM4m3yKjtPnPar9ZOw","stars":4,"text":"It's always difficult finding decent Mexican or Tex-Mex in NYC and having spent enough time down south, I tend to be much harder on the places that serve that kind of food around here. Taqueria Y La Fonda is one of those few and far between places in NYC that actually serves up really good Mexican/Tex-Mex. \n\nWalking up Amsterdam you can see that this is as hole-in-the-wall as it gets. Most good authentic Mexican tends to be these little understated places that people would cringe at rather than go in. Yes. This restaurant is much like that, however, it's not one of those authentic places where you are the only one sitting there in a dark corner listening to crickets chirping. Don't expect to be patted on the back for your pioneer spirit of eating here. It's a very well known place around the neighborhood, especially among the Columbia University kids. The reason why it's popular is not because it's a place where you can booze it up over mediocre Tex-Mex. You won't find tipsy, sorority girls cackling over frozen margaritas here. I think the only drink you can get is cerveza. The merit of this place is on the food alone. That's why it's popular. \n\nThe first thing that stands out are the freshly made chips with the three different varieties of homemade salsas, ranging from mild to hot. I love salsa verde so it was nice to see that 2 out of the 3 were variations of that. You can tell they didn't just buy a bulk bag of chips from a bodega and put it in a bowl like some other places. \n\nThe burritos here are so big that they draw attention from the other patrons sitting down. They all had this look on their face that I must have no idea what I was about to undertake. I ordered the pastor burrito, which comes with it's own deed and title. Cutting into the meaty behemoth I felt like I was trying to defuse a bomb. One needs the careful hands of a surgeon. I'm told that most people cannot finish one of the burritos here because of the sheer immensity of it. It was so delicious that I had no other cause but to finish it. \n\nThe next time I come here, and there will be a next time; I will make sure to have the tamales for a lighter fare. Everything is good here.

One glimpse through the window and I was instantly reminded of countless similar places in SoCal that, almost always, have delicious and inexpensive Mexican food. It's funky and unpretentious. I've lived near La Fonda for about six years and, in the beginning, I ate here a lot, frequently taking visiting friends from out of town for a convenient and delicious repast. They have a number of really tasty dishes. My favorite is probably the green pepper stuffed with pork, almond, and raisins and served with a cream sauce, rice, beans, and a small salad. They have a delicious black bean soup and their salads are very good too. I especially like the vegetable and avocado salad. \nThe burritos are the size of a small fireplace log. Enough for two meals easily.\nOne of my frequent dining companions always gets the asada burrito and loves it. The aguas frescas are very good, esp the pi\u00f1a and the orange. \nAs time went on, however, I found myself frequenting La Fonda less and less. The main reason is that, if you're dining with a companion, they almost never bring both dishes at the same time. Many have been the times when they deliver only one order and, by the time the second platter is served, the first person served is more than halfway through his/her meal. This is very annoying and it's a problem that I've experienced here on too many occasions. Now, when I eat there, I always tell the server, \"please bring both plates at the same time\". It shouldn't be necessary to give this instruction though and even then, they sometimes don't sync up the service.\nMy sole other gripe is with their chicken--they use only leg and thigh meat. When I've eaten their chicken tacos, I've frequently had to (how to say it politely?) spit out the gristly bits into a napkin. This isn't so much because the meat is not breast meat, but because of the lack of care taken in chopping up the meat in preparing it. Lastly, their delivery is waaay slow. I live practically right upstairs from the place and it took them more than 45 minutes to deliver a platter. When it arrived, it was lukewarm. If they tightened up their operation, I'd eat here--as I used to--much more often.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:27:59Z","yelp_user_id":"DiLCBLR83l717gqtcnOCTw"},{"business_id":"YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:52:07Z","date":"2010-07-13","review_id":"tN0l9vly88ROpL_t5Knt2A","stars":4,"text":"I can't believe I ate the whole thing!

Even though we made sure to repeat our order three times and have it repeated back to us to ensure it was understood, they still mixed up two of my friend's orders, and if one were a vegetarian it could have been the difference between dinner and no dinner. Also, they tacked on a mysterious delivery charge that caused my $10 Nachos to spike up to $16 when all was said and done (and the delivery charge was split between 3 people).\n\nThere was absolutely nothing special about the food. The best part about my meal was a wedge of avocado my friend had on the side of her burrito that she gave to me, so I probably could have walked to Appletree Market, bought an avocado, and saved myself $12.

Back to the front desk, where the first attendant decided he would accompany me on our third attempt to find a room.  Apparently that was the charm.  Went out of dinner and returned to spend some time in the lounge, which turns out to be the bright spot of this place - both servers were friendly, prompt, and efficient.\nReturned to the room to find a note had been kicked under the door.  The note was apparently from the manager (who couldn't be bothered to come out of the back room to straighten out the room mix-up), and read that we could call the desk a get a half bottle of wine, or enjoy a complimentary breakfast in their cafe.  We opted for the breakfast, which was a mistake.  The restaurant service and food quality was slightly below that of Denny's or IHOP.

We stayed here for a wedding that was held on campus, so we sort of had few choices, and were told by the couple that this would be our best option. \n\nThe nightmare started a month before we even stayed there, when we found out that they had mistakenly made our reservation for the correct date in the wrong month. Yep, they still charged us for it anyway, despite the fact that the reservation stated that it was for a particular wedding (can't they tell that the same couple isn't getting married two months in a row? I guess not.).\n\nUpon checking in, the woman at the desk handed us our card key, and told us to take the elevator to the correct floor. We went to that floor, walked around for quite awhile, trying to figure out where the heck they could have hidden our room. Finally, we went back downstairs to ask. She looked at us as though we were really stupid, and then told us that OBVIOUSLY, that room is in the building across the street. (duh?) So we had to trek our stuff across there in the pouring rain. Sweet.\n\nThe room was nice enough, but insanely small - we had a king sized bed, and there was barely enough room to get between the bed and the dresser/tv stand to get over to the bathroom. The upside: the bed was indeed comfortable. Which was good, because we had to order room service when all of the supposedly open (per their posted hours) restaurants in the hotel were closed. Sweet.\n\nThe morning we were to check out, we got several knocks on the door (despite the privacy please sign and being several hours before the 'official' check out time) from the lovely cleaning people who were just itching to clean our room. Each time, the person would tap on their invisible watch as if to say, uh, hey, we want to clean your room now, can you hurry it up? And when I looked at them, amazed, the person would huff, turn on their heel, and walk away. REALLY? Is this a high schooler angry with their parents for grounding them? \n\nBut to really put the icing on the cake, the hotel had to double charge us, too (this is a double charge not counting the one we had to pay a month in advance, so really, we paid three times to stay in this shitty hotel).  It has taken several phone calls with Kimberle (clearly a mental midget) to try and clear this up, and she might just be the least accommodating person working in any sort of a customer service positon, ever. \n\nSeriously, don't stay at this hotel unless you have to.

After hearing an obnoxious amount of people say that New Delhi is, \"by far,\" the best Indian food in Philly, I had to give it a try. What did I find? Meh.\n\nBeing a huge advocate for Indian food and a regular diner and buffet patron, I have been to my share of Indian restaurants in the area: Ekta, Tiffin, Himalayan, Delhi, Sitar, and the list goes on. The New Delhi dinner buffet is perhaps one-up from the bottom of my list. \n\nOptions-wise, they simply didn't have that much to offer; two chicken dishes, one of which featured \"white meat\" which was in fact dark, and tandoori chicken which wasn't horrible, but definitely on the dryer side. Their saag took on a shade that resembled an olive brown, rather than green--was the spinach fresh? Their vegetable pakoras consisted of pieces of puny, slightly burnt cauliflower pieces covered in gobs of batter; the pakora chicken wings were not burnt, but simply had almost no meat to them. The vegetable malai kofta were decent, but also not the best I've ever had. All in all, the buffet was a bit too americanized for my liking, (there was macaroni salad in the salad bar!), and not spicy in the slightest bit. Maybe that's why people like it? \n\nAll-in-all, the food was mediocre, some dishes even being cold (not intentionally), and not too many options to choose from on top of this. New Delhi is very attentive service-wise, however, with servers constantly coming around, asking how you are and attempting conversation. Not always what one wants when eating their meal; yet,  at least dirty plates were taken away speedily. They also serve you your choice of dessert to your table, which is a nice touch. The pistachio ice cream itself was just average, but I liked that aspect of their service nevertheless. \n\nIn the University City district, skip New Delhi and head on over to the tastier, albeit shabbier looking, Sitar a few blocks away. \n\nI'm giving New Delhi three stars because they also labeled the buffet item's if they were gluten-free or containing potential allergens, which pleased my gluten-sensitive self. I knew what I was getting, even if it didn't take the greatest.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:12:02Z","yelp_user_id":"VyRNaxX5-fG9dzfypQtUag"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:29:26Z","date":"2009-08-19","review_id":"5OPN8-gJhbXthly02zaJEQ","stars":3,"text":"For awhile after the original Minar Palace closed, New Delhi was my main source for Indian food.

Combine that with very tasty food and you can understand its popularity on yelp.\n\nUnderstand though, that Penn students are equally enamored with this spot, and since it is basically on their campus do not be surprised by lots and lots of noise. Obviously if you are a Penn student this doesn't bother you because you're the ones making the noise, but for the rest of us it takes some getting used to.\n\nWe initially considered the buffet, but upon inspection decided it was a bit sparse for anyone but an Indian newbie or hungry college student eating on the cheap, so we decided to go menu.\n\nWe ordered the chicken saag (mild) and chicken tikka mughlai (mild plus) - the latter being chicken cubes and fresh mushrooms cooked in a creamy tomato sauce - and it was exceptionally good. They say their cooking is on the spicy side, and mild plus was spicy enough for me. I was also impressed by the fresh, moist taste of the poori bread and paneer naan bread. For appetizers, there was nothing to complain about the meat samosas and bhojia, especially when combined with the traditional Indian dipping sauces provided. Sadly they were out of the barfi for dessert, and I was a bit disappointed when they only delivered two gulab jamun, though I suppose they're cheap enough to get two orders. To drink I has a traditional mango lassi, but if I return I am intrigued to try their strawberry version.\n\nAs far as outdoor dining goes, the Chestnut street sidewalk might be nice enough with the sun out, but at night it leaves a bit to be desired, as Chestnut Street at this block is a bit of a drag strip for passing cars, and a bit dirty. Obviously Penn students are used to this, as it is the standard in West Philly. (For tourists, note that UPenn can only exist in West Philly in 2011 with multiple campus police on every corner, and the tension is always there, whether Penn students are oblivious to it or not.)\n\nFinally, I must confess I am a Tandoor India loyalist and have been ordering there for 20 plus years. Your choice is between waiters slickly dressed in all black or more of a family staff and traditional Indian decor and music; between a starting point for a weekend evening on the town or a quiet place to have more intimate conversation.

I used to come here all the time during undergrad because it was cheap and satisfying (although some dishes, I think, were better at Sitar on 38th).  Not much has changed in way of food (except this time, I thought the chicken tikka masala was weird---maybe their sauce didn't have as much cream as I'm used to but Karma, over on Chestnut, btw. 2nd and Front, blows New Delhi's out of the water---and yes, I know, chicken tikka masala is not really authentic Indian food.  Whatever.  It's still pretty delicious.)  \n\nAnyway, food was great this time around and wish I had went back one more time to the buffet.  Typical offerings---samosas, naan, vegetable and chicken curries, rice, papri chaat, salad.  I chose kulfi ice cream for my dessert (comes with the buffet price) and I love love love kulfi---this was delicious--I like the whole cardamom taste of it.  A bit icy but nothing I couldn't overlook.  Also had masala chai with it (well, not really chai---masala tea which I then added my own cream to) and it didn't disappoint.  By the way, the masala tea is included in the buffet price, which I didn't know before...wish I did...would've ordered it every time I went in college.  \n\nThe pleasant surprise came from the decor.  I haven't been here in a couple of years.  In college, we used to joke that when eating at New Delhi, you always needed to adjust your eyesight because the lights got progressively dimmer throughout the meal---so much so that you practically couldn't see what you were eating by the end.  Maybe some thought it was for the ambiance but we all thought it was because they were trying to hide a dirty carpet.  Well, the \"dirty\" carpet is no more---the restaurant is much bigger, cleaner and more polished than before.  It's lost that typical, mom and pop-Indian restaurant feel, with a fancy-looking bar and bright lighting.  When I first walked in, I almost turned around because I thought I accidentally walked into one of the adjacent restaurants.  Definitely recommend it.

The kofta was abnormally sweet and the chicken wing, though crispy, had no flavor.  The others were very mediocre; it tasted like they used about half of the amount of usual spices.  I didn't expect any Indian buffet to be hot-spicy, but I expect my Indian food to have a lot of flavor.  These all just tasted like pre-made frozen or canned Indian food.  There was almost no effort put into making these.  I thought I could at least count on chutney to be spicy, but no even the onion coriander chutneys were a watery, sugary mess.  \n\nEven though I was full, I still got dessert because it's hard to go wrong.  My husband ordered mango ice cream, which was nice and thick, but it was probably from a tub of Reena's brand ice cream that you can find at your local Indian store.  The kulfi was the biggest disappointment of all.  Kulfi is a dense, creamy, pistachio ice cream, and it is VERY easy to make, so I'm not sure how a restaurant screwed it up. What they served was a small circle of icy, sweetened milk with no other flavors--no pistachio pieces in the ice cream (just a micro sprinkle on top), no cardamom, just ice crystals.  \n\nSeriously, I've had LOTS of Indian food in my life and I will never understand the need to so aggressively anglicize the food.  Restaurants need to stop \"dumbing down\" their food into some disgusting, unflavored slop.  Indian food is supposed to be known for it's flavors, and although not everything is spicy, one would expect SOMETHING to be. If you don't like any sort of flavor or spice, don't eat Indian food, it's just not for you.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:35:20Z","yelp_user_id":"w6RFOQf3tL2v6q93NYmSdQ"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:54:19Z","date":"2011-07-30","review_id":"clnhzJH5L1uejzV4ZjSK2g","stars":4,"text":"I went here with some friends for dining days and had a great experience.

Would have been three stars, but an incident earlier tonight warranted an automatic star deduction.  I'll explain below:\n\nNew Delhi Indian Restaurant is perfect for when you want a ton of Indian Food cheaply and in a hurry.  The restaurant operates almost exclusively as a buffet (I don't even know if there's an a la carte menu).  Going here feels much like going to a dining hall, except smaller.  You sit down, place your drink order, and then eat as much basmati rice, naan, chicken tikka masala, salad, or whatever is on the trays that evening as you care.  The young, noisy clientele really makes you feel like you're back in college.  Then you see the one or two older disheveled guys sitting by themselves in the corner or on the side eating alone to remind you that you're in the real world.\n\nThe food is actually not terrible: the basmati rice is flavorful, the naan is solid and able to hold a lot of the other dishes, the chicken tikka masala creamy, savory, and with large pieces of chicken, and the mutter paneer was a delight.  It was the lamb saag that got us.  While my serving had no major problems (just large chunks of dry lamb that had a little flavor), it was the BF's portion that made us both do a double take.  As he put the food in his mouth, he realized that something was hard to chew, and it was when he pulled a 6\" piece of plastic wrap out of his mouth, I knew that I could eat no more.  Utterly gross and horrible.\n\nWhile our waiters pushed us to enjoy one of the complimentary desserts included in the buffet, we honestly just didn't have the appetite to stomach it.  If not for the other time that we came here and had a pretty decent meal, I would have probably given this an automatic one star based on this experience alone.  However my rating reflects the average of our two trips here.  Maybe I'll come back if I can get over the plastic wrap hidden in the food.  But with another Indian buffet located around the corner and other cheap dining options nearby, it's hard to make a case for me to revisit New Delhi.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:19:39Z","yelp_user_id":"NqZJMXmwEtirJvx-qpyLmQ"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:24:06Z","date":"2012-02-05","review_id":"d-ug1-_ZyZWRKphnC5fW6g","stars":5,"text":"Cheap, delicious, and endless!

I have watched New Delhi grow from a crowded dark place with tons of refrigerated Indian candies on display up front (that no one seemed to buy) to an expanded polished place with a full-spread window system opening to outdoor seating at the front.  Over the years New Delhi has added more food offerings to its already fine buffet.  In fact, in 2011, New Delhi's improved salad bar added roughly 7 more items such as hummus and string bean salad.  I am quite happy they launched a campaign on their website to periodically distribute coupons. \n\nPlease note the buffet has different offerings everyday of the week.  I try to go only when vegetable malai kofta (wed, fri, sunday) is on the buffet menu because it's my favorite.

Era, Han Dynasty, Zot and now New Delhi, have broadened my edible horizons. \n\nOf course in this case, I credit Blake, for forcing me to break my Indian food cherry. It was her Indian food UYE, where she called me out specifically, that introduced me to the world of Naan bread and Tandoori chicken. \n\nVishnu must have really wanted me to eat Indian food. As it turned out, I had my kids on the night of the UYE and would have to miss the event. I had settled in, to a night of Funniest home videos and board games, disappointing both myself and others, who had wanted to see me get smacked down by ND's buffet. However, Karma was on my side and the class my wife takes on Wed was cut short. She showed up a little before 7,and I rushed to make it to ND on time for the event. \n\nLuckily, it was in a part of the city I knew well, as my therapist's office is across the street. This was ideal, in the possible scenario that the scary foreign food would make me need to get some mental help in a hurry, I would just need to crawl across the street. \n\nAs it turned out, there was no need. Between the great company and tasty food, I was mentally set, for at least a week. New Delhi is a cozy little restraunt, with a delicious looking spread of Indian food. After communing with some Yelpers, old and new, Blake was kind enough to be my guide at the Buffet and thank Shiva for that! She explained what each thing was and made great suggestions. \n\nI tried a little of everything and deemed the Naan bread and Tandoori chicken my favorites. I would need another visit to get a better idea of some of the other entrees, and I'm sure it will happen in the near future. There was even a bar there, although I didn't partake...this time. \n\nWe also had a blast with the desserts. Its amazing how much mileage a good \"balls\" joke will get, with a bunch of supposed adults. However I did not get the Balls dessert, no matter how much Aaron begged me. I tried the Pistachio ice cream, which had a name that sounded like coffee. As a matter of fact, I thought I was ordering coffee until they placed the dish of tan ice cream in front of me. My embarrassment turned to joy, as the frozen treat was awesome. \n\nUpon leaving, I felt like I had such a good experience, that I thought I would walk across the street and cancel all future therapy sessions. It was only when Aaron forced me to ride him piggyback across 41st street that I realized I actually needed to double the appointments...and I'm sure the homeless guy, and everyone else who witnessed it felt the same way.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:52:50Z","yelp_user_id":"AvGJVv7Z3a0q1MJT1Ykd0w"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:50:12Z","date":"2012-04-26","review_id":"JP28guRefBGaEvk-Vx7Vug","stars":2,"text":"This is the best Indian you got Philly?

No place has yet exceeded my friend's mom's authentic home cooking and other restaurants have tastier (or at least more novel) dishes than New Delhi.  I like Karma's pricier buffet better.  But New Delhi's buffet has an excellent selection of veggie and meat dishes (and fresh naan).

Aside from that I have to say that what they do have is pretty delightful. I can't remember the last time I had vegetable samosas but I ate it with gusto. The lamb curry is less lamb and more curry. The vegetable korma is fantastic. The chicken wings are unbelievable in their perfect blend of Indian and American unhealthiness.

The buffet offers plentiful self-servings of rice pudding which I like.  The latter contains pine nuts in a creamy, smooth sauce and is quite tasty, though everything else served in the restaurant is lackluster.  \n\nIf you order off of the regular menu you can probably specify the spiciness, but the buffet items are more or less bland.  The naan is unacceptably soggy and has probably been sitting under the dimmed buffet lights for an extended period of time.  If you prefer to have freshly baked naan, order off of the a la carte menu.  The mango lassi is not tart as one would expect the classic Indian drink to be, but is instead a shake.  The restaurant does not claim that it is a \"lassi\" per se but a \"mango shake.\"  It is simply a concoction of milk and mango ice cream, the latter being available as a complimentary dessert that accompanies the buffet.  Granted, there aren't too many tasty Indian restaurants in the vicinity, and this place offers delivery service.  I ordered delivery once because I suddenly had a craving for Indian food, and ordered chicken saag (and specified \"spicy\" which improved the flavors a bit) with naan.  The dish automatically came with rice.   \n\nThough New Delhi is indeed a sit-down restaurant, I'd prefer to patronize Rice and Spice on 42nd and Chestnut, which, though regrettably lacks a welcoming ambiance, serves what I consider to be above-average Indian fare.  A problem with Rice and Spice is that you probably have to bring a friend or two if you want variety.  The mango lassi there is actually a tart lassi and has a fairly thick consistency.  I've heard good things about Rice and Spice's chicken biryani and the serving portions are generous.\n\nThe waiters at New Delhi somewhat make you feel rushed because they clear the table very quickly for you when you order the buffet.

The pricing is decent, while a tad bit higher than Sitar India, the student discount concept applies here as well, and you can wrap up a nice buffet meal within 10-12 bucks, including tips, etc.  Not too shabby for the selection they have.\n\nIn the appetizer round, you get access to the usual tandoori chicken and samosas, as well as an assortment of papads (large crispy Indian chips, flavored with certain traditional spices).\n\nThe main course is your standard fare, but for the first time in UC, this is a restaurant that knows how to differentiate the base sauces for the different subzis (dishes).  Each has its own unique taste and texture, which makes for a good eating experience, with significantly differentiable food.\n\nAnd finally, they actually have an assortment of desserts that can be chosen from as part of their buffet.  Gulab jamun (dough balls in a sugar syrup), pista kulfi (traditional Indian pistachio ice cream), and an assortment of exotic ice cream flavors await the palate of the diner after their meal.\n\nThe one knock is the service staff, who seem to think that you're doing them a favor by coming to their restaurant, but given the buffet setting, it doesn't matter too much.  However, they are very good at refilling drinks on their own and clearing used plates relatively quickly.\n\nAll in all, with an extensive bar (cannot comment on quality of drinks personally, but the selection is extensive), good food, nice ambiance, and nice pricing, I highly recommend this for a try in UC.\n\nGood eats!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:07:01Z","yelp_user_id":"gr528N9hWldCgfKp99zWKw"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:05:33Z","date":"2009-10-25","review_id":"Tb9BGeiZHXOgrn_aGrWVew","stars":3,"text":"3.5 stars.\n      I went in here a few days ago to try the much vaunted Indian food here. \n        The place itself is really clean and looks like they either recently remodeled or just really take care of the place.

The vegetable samosa was the best outside of one of my old boss's wives samosa. Beautifully crisp outer shell, yet flaky and not over fried. The samosa filling was really good and had a fair amount of spice. The chicken tikka masala was really good and rivaled Tiffin's. The mutter paneer was pretty good, though in truth I probably like Tiffin's better. Though to be fair, Tiffin cooks theirs on demand vs. ND's sitting around in a warmer. Speaking of which the trays were so hot that the serving handles were almost too hot to touch. \n\nOn my second pass I tried the lamb saag, dal mahkni and another dish who's name escapes me. The Lamb in the lamb saag was very tender and had some flavor to it. The green sauce looked horrible, like something from the movie Swamp Thing. However it tasted pretty good.

I generally like my food really hot, but I was persuaded to go with the \"medium\" level, which was like 4 down from the top level! I'm kind of glad I was. It was pretty hot, probably around the hottest level at other places, and I hear that the hottest level here is inedible. I might go to \"medium plus\" next time. \n\nMy favorite was the paneer makhni--\"cheese cubes cooked in tomato sauce with butter.\" It was freaking delicious, with a creamy red sauce and perfectly textured cheese cubes. The vegetable malai kofta was extremely similar, but it had fried veggie dumpling-ish things in it.  Of course, the naan was good. \n\nEverything arrived right at the promised time, and the driver was pleasant. All in all, the tab was $32 with fees and tip, not too bad for dinner.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:35:07Z","yelp_user_id":"7ktyPHE-NGnWxarOqjIQiQ"},{"business_id":"YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:47:03Z","date":"2012-07-16","review_id":"X0fqnwOmYpbDp_byhsjVTw","stars":4,"text":"Who would have thought one of the best ice creams in University City could be found here?!

I remember the first time I came and I had the most amazing buttery Chicken Tikka ever but the second time I came back it doesn't seem that amazing anymore, but it sure came back this time around.

Gorgeous, crunchy samosas filled with potatoes and green peas, one of the best I've had in the city for sure. Soft lamb meatballs in a yellow curry, Chicken tandoori, Palak Paneer, fried wings, naan, basmati rice. There were at least a dozen different dishes for the diners to choose from and it was only $8.95 per person for lunch and $11.95 for dinner. Since the movie theater is so close, I usually would come here to eat before or after a movie, or even when I got too tired of waiting for the bus right outside.\n\nOne thing though, the server doesn't seem to speak great English and when they came over to take the plate that my friend was trying to finish, we had to say no for like 6 times before the server left us alone.

Mr. Lee Lee's bakery is a throwback to the days of yore, when small, quaint places run by independent shop-owners who poured their soul into their product abounded. And make no mistake, this gentleman bakes his rugelach with love, from the crispy, flaky melt in your mouth crust to the nuts and chewy raisins stuffed inside each roll that have your tastebuds screaming --this is one terrific cookie. This is rugelach for those who scoff at calories, diets, who have scoured the earth for good rugelach and have been disappointed. I have read every review on rugelach in NYC and after eating Mr. Lee Lee's cookie, knew I had finally been granted entry to rugelach heaven. Walk two short blocks from the train- station to this charming nook and you will be transported to another decade where time stands still and the only hum you hear will be the purr from your stomach. I was there one afternoon and three older ladies were just whiling away the time, sipping tea and eating their cake. Mr. Lee Lee makes rugelach in both chocolate and raisin; get both, savor the first, be addicted to the raisin. He also bakes Southern style cakes and has a Southern breakfast, with grits. Sadly, Mr. Lee had closed down recently due to a lack of pedestrian traffic. He re-opened after local furor--and many tears from those stomachs that were bereft of his amazing cookie. Put this rugelach artist on the map finally. Your belly will growl with pleasure and you will understand what soul food really means.\n\nA word of advice-the master takes his time. Call before you go to make sure he has rugelach. He does not mass produce. He coddles each piece to perfection. So call ahead and ask him to put aside some rugelach if you don't live in the nabe.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:18:58Z","yelp_user_id":"wHxDyAegrNiUzqXBKjAbvQ"},{"business_id":"YNgBR2pGWmMZAYFQbByODA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:53:40Z","date":"2012-07-08","review_id":"gsinKxT_JuaOvKpJ4hRhEw","stars":5,"text":"One of my favorite bakeries in all of New York City!!

Of course, I'm not sure how much street cred that gives the place.  Living in [and eating my way through] Harlem, this is the first time I've stumbled across the pastry of Jewish Ashkenazic origin.  So, as far as I know, it's the ONLY place in Harlem to buy rugelach.  Feel free to e-mail me if I'm wrong.  Actually, please do.\n\nAlthough this does not necessitate expertise - like the cookie itself - I am too of Jewish Ashkenazic origin. So, let me preface my review with the following statements: I've eaten my way in rugelach across Williamsburg [go to greens for the \"babka\" (mind you, it's not actually babke - it's kokosh), NOT the rugelach!] and Boro Park.  I've tried it in the shukkim [markets] all over Israel.  I've sat down and snacked on them with the winter birds of the temperate Boca Raton [bridge, anyone?].  My grandparents pushed rugelach on me like martinis on WASPs.  I know my rugelach.\n\nSo, I was excited to try the \"Rugelach by a brother.\"  Very excited, actually.\n\nIt was decent.  The outside was buttery and soft without being overly flaky or extremely chewy [a crisp finish, if you will].  Solid texture.   But the flavor?  It wasn't quite sweet enough for me - maybe they needed some vanilla.  I tried both the standard and the chocolate, and found the fruitiness overpowered the flavors of the cinnamon, sugar, nuts, and chocolate [clearly in the chocolate variety].  These little babies need nurturing and balance.\n\nIn addition, chocolate rugelach and cinnamon rugelach were not born equally.  They should taste different.  They have different notes to stress! The chocolate rugelach was too reminiscent of the cinnamon - with a chocolate coating.  Oddly though, the chocolate rugelach was noticeably chewier than the cinnamon.\n\nWould I go here again if I was craving rugelach?  Maybe.  It's a convenient location.  \n\nBut, if I do get the craving, I'll probably just trek down to Zabar's.  [Or follow Sam P's advice and go to Epicure in the m-i-a.]","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:31:55Z","yelp_user_id":"YtiGF_UCUf91B2z3bed4lg"},{"business_id":"YNgBR2pGWmMZAYFQbByODA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:41:50Z","date":"2009-04-20","review_id":"vqZ0VknTRBqCk3PP3GhfUQ","stars":3,"text":"i had the chocolate mousse cake which was good.  chocolate cake + chocolate mousse is pretty hard to mess up so it wouldnt be fair to give anymore than 3 stars.  \n\nsomething about the place is just not inviting but i didnt care, i had to give it a try at least once.  \n\nreading the other reviews i guess i'd probably give it more stars if i actually ate rugelach.  not sure what its \"supposed\" to taste like but everytime ive tried it ive hated it.   im not going to try it again---nope--not even from a black bakery in harlem.  sorry, cant do it.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:20:30Z","yelp_user_id":"4mHtBoPr-V_h9TWZJGT9yQ"},{"business_id":"YNgBR2pGWmMZAYFQbByODA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:53:26Z","date":"2012-03-16","review_id":"XN78ObV-BOritU6k49-Suw","stars":5,"text":"Love, Love Love!!!!

The only thing I enjoyed was the carrot muffin, not for the taste, but for its texture; crunchy on top, soft on bottom. The rugelach had the worst performance, which was ironic since this was the most well known item from this bakery.\n\nPerhaps it's famous because of its tag line 'Rugelach from a brother'. I'd say people just love the 'idea' of this place rather than the goods sold here.\n\nOverall, highly disappointed... I like supporting small businesses, but golly, I would like to know that it's made with quality. This place has been open for 9 years, and the owner has been a baker in Harlem for a good 30 years.

I mentioned to him that it was my first time at his truck and he said he hopes I will enjoy the crepe and come back.

You will be shocked at the culinary perfection that can come out of such an unassuming food truck on Drexel campus. The crepes range from $5-$8 which may be a lot for a food truck, but the quality of crepe you get makes it a huge steal. Seriously, the skin of the crepe is cooked just the right amount and has the perfect thinness. \n\nSpring crab is delicious. I was worried the cream cheese would be too heavy/salty like you usually get but I was blown away by how perfectly seasoned the cream was and how nicely it complemented the crab meat. Btw, there was tons of crab meat - gotta love a food truck that's not stingy with its meat! Also, he sliced a couple pieces of tomato on the top - it baffles me how much care and presentation goes into these crepes!\n\nVegetable crepe is great as well - the spinach is creamed perfectly. Love the added seasonings and the magic sauce he drizzles on. The sweet crepe with coffee cream is a winner as well (have stolen a taste from a friend's) - I will be going back to get my own soon!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:19:43Z","yelp_user_id":"AocvLld2_GeimgYQD0GAMw"},{"business_id":"YNl2JK7qqYyHqKc4bbKivg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:42:58Z","date":"2009-11-09","review_id":"l2oCDhNI3CBKRair5T1CcA","stars":5,"text":"I have not eaten here often, because the lines usually scare me away, but I really should do it more often. La Dominique, a crepe lunch truck run by Zbigniew Chojnacki, is frankly delicious. And its proprietor, who is also an artist, makes the crepes into little works of art themselves. The first time I had ever ordered anything here, I was having a bad day, and the apple cinnamon crepe on the menu (which changes seasonally--I didn't notice this one today) seemed to fit the bill to cheer anyone up.\n\nWatching him make the crepes is almost as fun as eating them. Every step has its due: he slices apples to order, arranges them in an attractive fan shape on the warm, buttery crepe, which is then laced with swirls of caramel sauce, pralines, whipped crime, more pralines... suffice to say this was a rather divine experience.\n\nThere are also savory crepes on the menu, with a daily-changing special. For example, today's was a veal stew. There is a smoked salmon breakfast crepe that I am dying to try one day, as well as a coconut chicken veggie crepe, served with steamed rice. Today, I ordered the pepperoni pizza veggie crepe (which may be slightly blasphemous to both pizza and crepes, but was reassuringly tasty, with pepperoni, melted mozzarella, and copious amounts of thinly sliced onions). There are a number of different combinations to choose from, all of them wrapped in that light, airy, signature crepe. I also noticed the girl in line ahead of me order some pierogies which looked incredibly tasty, served with onions and dollops of sour cream--I might have to make another trip back for that.\n\nThe only downside that I can think of is that it's very slow on school days at lunch time, and the lines can be intimidatingly long, but it's always worth the wait.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:48:56Z","yelp_user_id":"BTKCSvPiy7anahF2HhNNNA"},{"business_id":"YNl2JK7qqYyHqKc4bbKivg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:57:59Z","date":"2011-08-17","review_id":"ngORnhEnJcUyJFXvDpoSzg","stars":4,"text":"I always forget La Dominique is close to my work, but after the Mexican crepe I had today it'll be hard to forget what a delicious and inexpensive lunch I had.

It is a quaint little spot with no other trucks around it.  The owner has proudly posted an article about him and his truck on the front window.  Surprisingly quiet block.\n\nService:  So you queue up in line and wait for him to finish making the prior order and take your order (one at a time!)  So stand around or lean on the railing and be prepared to let newcomers know you haven't ordered and they have to fall in line.  Waiting around isn't a problem as long as you have the time and weather conditions permit.  It is accurate to say that the owner is precise, almost methodical, with his technique.  DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE IN A RUSH.  Because 1 - he will not rush for you and 2 - you want him to take the time on your meal because it will be all the better for it!

I've tried them in the crepe motherland (France) and am always interested in trying new crepe places because let's face it, they're one of the most delicious things you can eat on this planet, if done right. \n\nHouston Hall has passable crepes, but given the choice in University City, food trucks are where it's at for crepes. Who would have guessed? A few of my coworkers are obsessed with the Crepewalk crepe truck on spruce st near 36th (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crepes-and-wraps-food-truck-philadelphia) and I dig their blackened chicken crepe as well as the grilled chicken crepe there. But one day a third coworker of mine claimed that there was yet another, better crepe truck. Enter the contender, La Dominique. \n\nWith two crepe carts vying for \"best crepe around\", we all knew there was only one way to settle this, and that was a crepe off. One wednesday lunch, 6 crepes were purchased... 3 Mexican crepes from La Dominique and 3 blackened chicken crepes from Crepewalk. Since my coworkers were all somewhat biased to favor their favorite crepe cart, I came in to serve as the most impartial of the crepe testers (best job ever). \n\nAlthough I hesitated to really choose one crepe definitively over another (they both really are very good!), clearly my stomach and my actions spoke louder, since I only took bites of the blackened chicken, saving most of my appetite for the edible work of art that is the Mexican crepe. Somewhat sweet but savory, like a taco in a crepe with fresh veggies and herbs on top. It was pretty divine. Maybe it was just the novelty of this Mexican crepe compared to the blackened chicken that I had had before that made it so delicious... but I don't think that was the only reason why I liked it so much. It's just a damn good crepe! It's only too bad that it's almost double the distance from my workplace compared to the other carts, and lines can get pretty insane unless you bypass prime lunch times and go early or late. All I can say is, if you want an awesome crepe... check out this cart, get the Mexican crepe and watch the artist chef in action.

I was a bit worried when our $13 appetizer came out; it was only the size of a small plate. But it turned out to be so rich that my boyfriend and I together could not finish it if we were going to have any room for the entrees. We left a bit of dip, some cucumbers and tomatoes. We didn't finish the entrees either, I've got some mousaka in my fridge for tomorrow.\n\nQuality:\nHonestly, I felt the appetizer was more exotic and flavorful than the entree. But maybe that's just because I love garlic and the appetizer sampler included an extremely garlicky dip. Either way, everything we had was delicious and fun to eat. Everything was very authentic, which counts for a lot of points in my book. Where else are you going to get real Greek food in Morningside Heights? Also, they had vegetarian versions of a lot of Greek classics, which was exciting for me because as a vegetarian, I usually have to pass up many Greek specialties. Also, I was impressed that they had a specialty Greek wine called Retsina. This wine sits in pine barrels instead of oak barrels, giving it a distinctive taste; retsina is traditional in Greece and unique to the country. I tried it for the first time, just the house wine here in a carafe, and it was great. \n\nAtmosphere:\nGreat art, very friendly service. Not too crowded.

It doesn't get old.\n\nThe souvlaki is decent, nothing special but also can't fault it. The sangria is (obviously) delicious, I could subsist on nothing but sangria if I had to. The appetizer pita bread is free, bottomless and delicious and finally the gyro platter is filling, perhaps a bit too filling. I could hardly move afterwards.\n\nAll in all, a great place to go for lunch, sangria and casual conversation.

This place is a staple for Columbia students and professors and has been for decades. It is an institution run by a bunch of old-school Greeks - not  an establishment out to garner attention from the New York Times and I think this must be taken into consideration when reviewing it. The atmosphere is genial, kooky and literary  - the menus and decor are inspired by the Greek play, Symposium, all about the different types of love. The wooden tables and booths are worn smooth by generations of diners. The sangria is cheap and good and comes with a big honking wooden spoon. The owner is a doll and remembers regulars (like I was). The little jar of mints on the glass counter up front is a delightful yet unhygenic relic. And of course, the flaming cheese is always a spectacle that warrants a loud OPA from the owner as he carries it out.\nLook, most of the dishes are mediocre, but you gotta know what to order! The Symposium Salad is divine and I dream about all its salty dips. The pita is excellent and freshly made. Baklava, sweet and delicious. The meat? Eh. The fish? Probably wouldn't order it. This is one of those places that Time forgot, so go and appreciate it for what it is (and ordering the right thing helps). I am the last person to say something like this, but it's not really about the food at Symposium - it's about everything else. It's long been a Columbia haunt and it has stubbornly resisted the yuppification and severe makeovers that almost every other NYC restaurant has undergone. People pack into this place year after year because they appreciate the unique charm that this restaurant has - and it rubs off. You lurch up the steps out onto the street warm and happy from sangria and cheer.

Spicy, and made with real chiles.  Then the chopped chiles in oil, more chile than oil.  And the sauce for the flounder, which we had served on the side and dipped everything into.  Then tossed some onto the rice.  Then took the rest home.  Balanced, layered, and no MSG headache.\n\nService?  They left us alone.  Opened our bottle.  Refilled our waterglasses. Served food when it was ready, asked whether we were enjoying things.  Then left alone--the way I like it.\n\nSuch a happy meal.  The best Chinese food we've had in town or recently.\n\nSo good!\n\nwe picked up a to go menu on the way out, and lunch is $6.50-7.  Cheaper than Karen's, but so much better.\n\nWe're definitely returning, even if only for the duck.\n\nUpdate 4/12/09:We now come here nearly every week for the whole fried flounder, sauce on the side (the unfinished sauce taken home each time because it really is that good with vegetables, plain rice, as a scallop marinade--anything really).\n\nMongolian lamb was good, but not superlative.  A little too sticky-sweet for my taste, with a hint of molasses.  \n\nThe place has not been crowded in awhile, which is fine for us.  Once the weather finally improves, the patio will again be packed.\n\nThe interiour is a bit ugly, but who really cares when the food is so good that we return again and again?\n\nEdit 4/14:\nI won't downgrade this place because we love their fried flounder and will return repeatedly for it, weekly if possible, but there are some things we have to remember.\n\n1.  specials might be wierd.  On Easter, we ordered the bunny special.  It was primarily rib meat and bones.  A good flavour, but way too much work.  Kind of like kimchee basted rabbit connective tissue.  There was no bite which didn't have something to spit out.\n2. appetizers: they're good, but not great. we had the meat skewers and spring rolls (fried--I thought they would be the cold version), but seriously, they're merely ok\n\nThe service is prompt and great, and we will continue to eat here for their incredible flounder and duck.  Weekly is what it has become, but now that we're looking for a house, it may be bi-weekly.  Still, what they do great we'll be fans of and come back for--gladly--but the other stuff?  Leave it.\n\nUpdate 6/6/09:\nI've vowed to get their curry ever since we first started dining here a few months ago (each time the plate came by for another table I started drooling), and wasn't disappointed.  The chicken is tender, there's excellent flavour with a medium heat level (by my standards), and the vegetables sauteed but with a bite (more cooked than a stir-fry, but that is how it ought to be).\n\nNow I know where to get my Chinese curry fix which is almost as good as my mother's.\n\nThank you Ivy Garden!\n\nUpdate 10/18/09: I hope this was an off day, but I'm not feeling generous today and will ding them a star.  The flounder was perfect but the duck a bit greasy.  Then that amazing sauce for the flounder--it was BLAND.  Zero flavour.  Cornstarch with brown colouring.  We didn't even bother finishing or taking anything home--a first for us.  \n\nSo we're 2/2 in terms of places going bad on Nassau since we moved--first Old World Pizza, now this place.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:37:44Z","yelp_user_id":"BwC6JnnmWP50MS6UubOv6Q"},{"business_id":"ypwAHNow4r90cVFNfDoVAw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:00:53Z","date":"2008-05-05","review_id":"iz6lO6WELCCN1YgD_oYoPQ","stars":2,"text":"I came here looking for decent Chinese food... and yet again I've been disappointed with Princeton's selection.

I got chicken and black bean sauce, which so far every Chinese restaurant has been able to make the right way. Almost every Chinese restaurant that is. I don't know what the chef was thinking, but the whole sauce seemed to come from a bottle of soy sauce, except for the black beans.

As other reviewers have noted, I sooo wanted to love this place.\n\nIt was a Wednesday night, around 9:30ish, so there was no wait (that was a plus). Ambience was nice, Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing was playing - sweet! (another plus). But my giddiness soon came to a screeching halt. It started with the wine. The waiter (super nice guy) wasn't well versed with the wine list. I ordered a bottle of Riesling, and he insisted it was from Africa. Hmmm... I'm not a wine snob, but c'mon man, Rieslings are mainly German - good ones that is. France turns out a decent Riesling, even Australia, but Africa? Pftt. After he realized he was wrong, he comes back to deliver the news that they were out of Riesling and brings me a Moscoto. My friend isn't a heavy drinker, so I went with it. But it wasn't till I saw the bill later that I realized the waiter failed to mention that the Moscoto was $17 more than the original bottle I ordered. That's a negative in my book buddy! Not to mention the Moscoto sucked! Almost $50 for a sucky Moscoto is not cool.\n\nOn to the food. I ordered from the appetizer menu, Baby Back Ribs ($14- kinda steep for an app in my opinion) with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes . The ribs were just OK; a bit on the fatty side. The mashed potatoes were cold and chunky, and did not have the slightest hint of garlic to them. The waiter noticed my dismay and took my dish back to the chef for an added dose of garlic, and a quick nuke in the microwave (I presume). It tasted a tad bit better, but needless to say I didn't eat much more. All-in-all a very disappointing meal. \n\nMy friend ordered the Shrimp & Grits, the most expensive dish on the menu at $26. I saw that he was struggling to swallow even a few bites. I'm not a grits kind of gal, so I can't judge fairly, but from what I tasted, it was just not good. And the shrimp - do not get me started - was the most overcooked shrimp I have ever tasted. Wait, I can't even say that I tasted it, because I could not even cut through it with my knife! That's how hard and overcooked they were! When the waiter came over, I demonstrated my attempt to slice and he quickly realized we were not exaggerating. He was super apologetic- I felt so bad because he looked like he was taking it as a direct reflection of his service. They offered to make us another meal, but we had enough already and passed on the idea. \n\nThe one good thing is that the manager removed the charge for the Shrimp & Grits without hesitation. But, even though they removed the meal from the bill, we still spent more than we should have based on the fact that we paid for the overpriced wine, and tipped the waiter extremely well, since he really did try his best to fix things. Worst part - all that money spent and we left hungry!\n\nSorry Chocolat, but you will never earn my business again. The only reason I granted you 2 stars was because of your waiter, and the fact that you rectified the bill. But this experience really deserved 1 star, because the food was simply awful! And it's all about the food for me!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:22:29Z","yelp_user_id":"gzvE5fwgwvU2rkbi31ZgoA"},{"business_id":"YRfDdBgWS4T80oJfKmVThA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:31:24Z","date":"2011-07-25","review_id":"2lTlDAU8ihSgUSNYfOuOrA","stars":2,"text":"I REALLY wanted to like Chocolat but I was pretty unimpressed with this place.

It was a large party (about 15) of friends and family.  When you enter the establishment there is a full bar on your left and several tables on your right.  I didn't see much of the place because apparently my friend had reservations or something and we were promptly escorted to a secluded room off to the side.\n\nThe decor in this room was very classy.  The perimeter of the room was lined with couches.  There were tables and upholstered stools to match the couches.  The service was a little slow but not terrible for such a large party and it being a Friday evening. \n\nI shared a pitcher of Sangria.  It was very good but you might want to ask for \"lite fruit\" (similar to requesting \"lite ice\").  The pitcher was supposed to supply four glasses.  Due to the fruit is was more like three 3/4 full glasses.  The waiter noticed our disappointment and brought out another pitcher free of charge.  Others in my party had alcoholic drinks and said that they were nice...and strong.\n\nAs you see from the photos, the food presentation was appealing.  All of the portions from appetizers to entr\u00e9es were a good size.  I had the spare ribs and sweet potato fries.  The ribs were tender and well done.  I heard no complaints from the others at my table besides being too full to finish their meal! No one did dessert.  The birthday girl's mom brought a cake. \n\nThe food and drinks are not cheap.  That pitcher of sangria was around $20 and the entr\u00e9es averaged about 20-25 bucks.  Of course there's also tax and gratuity applied. Not cheap but it is what it is.  Not the worse I've seen.  Harlem real estate IS getting pricey these days.  \n\nI read some of the comments on here before and after I went to Chocolat.

That's the end of the good. Plenty of bad: \nWe sat down in a nearly empty room at @ 2:30 on a Sunday. But the lunch menu was not available. We could get brunch or DINNER. They serve bread during dinner. But if you order dinner on the weekend, you can't have bread. Who's on first? At least everything came out quickly.\n\nI ordered a cocktail. I love a good cocktail. Too bad I didn't get one. At $14 a pop they should have revealed that they were not capable of making what I ordered because they did not have the ingredients. Let ME decide if I want a modified version. The main missing ingredient was something they could have bought in a grocery store. They even admitted they knew in advance that they were out but did not try to obtain it.\n\nThen I went to one of the 3 separate bathrooms. I won't tell you what was on display in the toilet of the 1st one. I went to the last bathroom, but the lock was broken. Having already activated the launch sequence, I had to take my chances & I used that facility anyway. But then I tried to wash my hands. There was no soap coming out of the dispenser. It made me wonder about where the staff washed their hands.\n\nAs we were putting on our coats to leave, I spoke to the person who turned out to be the manager. He had been standing there watching when I brought my cocktail back to the bar to complain, but he had made no effort to address or even acknowledge the issue. So imagine my surprise to find out he was a mgr. He said he was \"immensely sorry\" about everything. He offered to buy a drink or dessert, but I was driving and full so I declined. Raincheck.\n\nWhen you are in an off-brand neighborhood and charge entree prices for appetizers and $14 for cocktails your game needs to be much tighter than that. (BTW - Brunch was very expensive - about $22 for my seafood omlet - with just OK ingredients and no extras. No mimosas, no bread, no nothing) I know they are relatively new, but this death by a thousand papercuts. At least the food wasn't bad. Nothing special.

A group of 18 of us went to Chocolat for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night and waited 1 hour and 45 minutes in order to get our entrees out. The wait was so long that the manager and the waiters apologized and brought out bread with olive oil to tie us over since our entrees were taking so long. The olive oil dip was quite unpleasant. The couple eating next to where I was sitting came after us, ordered and ate 3 courses, and left all before I received the garden salad that I ordered. The manager, in an attempt to make us stay after an hour, offered to take care of all the drinks we ordered while waiting for our food. We were surprised that in a conversation with the owner, he said such an adjustment could not be made. Further, he continued to opine that he thought waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes for entrees for a table of 18 people was quite \"quick and reasonable.\" I am not sure if he was also saying this of the salads that took a similar amount of time to get out. \nWe were quite content paying our full bill, but we stayed because of the managers offer. The owner, in saying that such an adjustment couldn't be made by him, could have waived the mandatory 18% gratuity from our bill and that would have been sufficient. Instead, the owner is allowing the portion of the drinks that the manager offered to have waived from our bill, over $200, is come out of his (the managers) paycheck - even though this was a complete breakdown by the entire restaurant, and just an admission/acknowledgment of our poor service and waiving of gratuity would have been sufficient. The owner did not even want to admit that a 1 hour 45 minute wait was outrageous.  \nOn to the food, which I can only describe as overpriced and underwhelming. Most of my party described the food as lacking flavor (esp. the Madeira Chicken), the chicken for the Caesar salad tasted rubbery and after three bites, another member of the party stopped eating the shrimp and grits. \nOverall, this was a disappointing experience service wise and food-wise.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:13:55Z","yelp_user_id":"ssfigvqhB1uwJLcH9JiluA"},{"business_id":"YRfDdBgWS4T80oJfKmVThA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:30:47Z","date":"2011-07-01","review_id":"Ksxpx_VxOn2NlYaMIUqYUQ","stars":2,"text":"Not a fan at all for what you get here.

Last night, it was dinner and previously, it was Sunday brunch. If I were to rate Chocolat solely based on my brunch experience, I would have given 2 stars. There wasn't anything that was \"signature\" about the restaurant, aside from the cheddar-bacon grits, which I would say- I'm a true fan. However, having glanced over a few of the other reviews, I would agree that they're having growing pains. It may be the \"soft launch,\" but the eggs benedict were too well done. EB are a NYC brunch institution, and if you're going to serve them (and at a significant premium v. Settepani, Les Ambassades and other choices nearby), poach them correctly. I think where they need to improve is the basic blocking and tackling. Upsell liquors and desserts! Dinner is what notched them up to a 3. I had the seared scallops and they were quite delectable. As an appetizer, had the beet salad w/ breaded goat cheese turnover. The salad was too soggy and too heavy on the beets. Scallops could have been a bit more tender, which leads me to wonder the quality of their supplier (or frozen?). What's good is the DJ effect playing great music! Not too loud or hip-hoppy, just right.

It's my thing. You all also know that I rarely issue 1-star ratings in the many years I've been reviewing restaurants (in fact, this is just the 2nd time I've been prompted to even give a restaurant a 1-star rating).\n\nBefore I go IN, what did go right: our waitress was generally friendly and attentive (up until she gave us attitude at the end) smh.\n\nWith this said, my experience at Chocolat went from \"ok\" to \"wow, I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone\", followed by \"what did I do to deserve this?!\"\n\nThis past Sunday was my dear friend's bday (an editor in the publishing/fashion industry) who is friends with Leon, the owner. We had just wrapped up celebrating on her rooftop and were ready to unwind over dinner & call it a day.\n\nHow the beautiful struggles unfold: \n1) We walk in, my friend asks to be seated @ the back table. We're rebuffed with a no...but as we take a look around, there are only 2, yes TWO parties dining in the restaurant! \n2) There was no silverware on the table\n3) Our waitress asks us: \"Would you like bread?\"...umm, I know that this may be a cost-saving measure on your part but why even ask?! That's a first. \n4) Spoke to the manager (on the nite of August 5, 2012) whether birthday cake was complimentary on a guests' birthday. He said yes...Sure enough, a $10 charge for the cake appeared on our check! $10! Cake costs less at finer establishments (a la Chez/Red Rooster!!)\n5) Said $10 cake came with a swirl of whipped cream (not scoop of icecream). Fine. When friend asked for scoop of icecream to go along w/ it, our waitress told us that the restaurant doesn't offer it. Not that night, not ever. \n\nINTERESTING coming from a restaurant called CHOCOLAT! One would think the dessert options would be exhaustive\n\n6) Added 18% gratuity on a party of 3 ppl. THREE ppl! When we questioned good ol' waitress lady, she said it's a policy they implemented 'months ago' and it's done based on the amount of the bill. OUR BILL WAS $65. WHAT KIND OF SCHEME DISGUISED AS A FINE DINING ESTABLISHMENT IS THIS?! And of course, she couldn't quote the amount that bills have to be in order for the server to instate the 'required' 18% gratuity charge. Just the most ridiculous *ish I've ever heard in my life. EVER. \n\n7) Waitress had the nerve to get an attitude with us for her and the restaurants' actions. No need to take it personal, IF you're being forthcoming and doing your job. She actually was making comments (along with the bartender) as we were walking out the restaurant!, including \"Have a great night and we hope to see you back!\" but said very sarcastically. Was just totally unneeded and unnecessary. But I guess when you're running a biz that has no ambitions but to be an around-the-way place, that's how your employees will conduct themselves........\n\nThroughout the entire experience, not ONCE did the manager (male manager working during dinner service on Aug. 5th) bother to come to our table to try to attend to our concerns, smooth things over, or make amends. But with all the foolishness that took place, I wouldn't dare show my face either! \n\nFor this mistake, I will keep my dollars at 5 & Diamond, Chez Lucienne, Settepani, Lido's and Jacobs (for my down home meal fix)! That is all.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:27:08Z","yelp_user_id":"nIWCQgZJXKledwXfhgjemQ"},{"business_id":"YRfDdBgWS4T80oJfKmVThA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:40:20Z","date":"2011-02-19","review_id":"XuxV_8DbFuSjTv6c13I8qg","stars":1,"text":"I was with a party of four that was seated in less than 5 minutes but unfortunately the food took over an hour to come out.

I loved the fact that the vet techs and office staff seemed to really love animals. I think my dog, when I first took him in, must have consumed at least a half bag of treats and there was a real effort to make him comfortable. I also loved that they worked with a shelter to adopt out homeless cats. Such a great thing. On my second visit, I adopted one of these kittens. She was small- about five months, and I paid an adoption fee that I was informed included her spay, but \"We'll do that later, because she's so tiny. We'd like to wait till she grows.\"\n\nSo far so good. But about here is where things went downhill. I noticed that Riverside often charged excessive fees. Little things, like I'd be asked if I wanted to cut my dog's nails. I'd say fine, and notice there was a minimal charge for it on the bill that hadn't been mentioned. No big deal. I'd make an appointment for a Wellness checkup for my kitten, where she'd receive several vaccinations, and be advised not to give her a particular shot today, since she'd had so many to avoid overwhelming her system. Fine. But when I came back for that final shot two weeks later, I was charged $80 for *Another* Wellness checkup and informed that every time you go in for shots that is charged. We spent less than five minutes with a vet! Finally I was told that spaying was only included in the adoption fee if you happen to adopt the cat when it had already been spayed. That would have been fine had that been what I was initially told, but I most certainly had been told something else. \n\nThe final time I came in with my cat, she seemed stressed, which I attributed to all the unfamiliar animals. The vet did not agree- worse- said she seemed to be in physical pain and so recommended giving her a muscle relaxant and pain killer.  Who would refuse relieving a cat that was in pain?! So of course I got very anxious and said yes. Had I missed my cat being hurt all this time? I felt awful. However, after giving the muscle relaxant, then they proceeded to take over three hours to administer her vaccination, despite noticing that she was very stressed/in pain. They simply left her in the back of the building, in her carrier. At first I tried to be understanding. It was a weekend and I had errands to do, so I asked if I could come back after making a grocery run. Fine. An hour later? Cat not ready. Ok. I live a couple blocks away. 45 minutes after that? Still not ready. I waited another half hour in the lobby until they gave my cat her vaccinations, and I paid my larger-than-expected bill and took her home. Nothing more was said/done about her seeming to be in pain. It seemed to me so egregious- if she was in pain, figure out why- painkiller is undertreatment. If not in pain, just give her her vaccination quickly so we can go home and remove the stress of the situation asap. Don't keep her several hours and give her unnecessary drugs.\n\nI hated feeling this way. This was my vet- I wanted to trust them unquestioningly, because of course they know better than I do. But if you start feeling like unnecessary treatments are being foisted on you just to make an extra buck, you start questioning every thing. Every last suggestion, every tiny, unexpected charge. Only you don't even have the basis or knowledge to question. You're no medical professional. You just have this vague sense of distrust and feeling of being taken advantage of. This was how I felt at Riverside- like I was buying a used car and had to be wary.\n\nMy last interaction upset me so much that I emailed them and explained why I could no longer be a client. In response, a woman called and apologized for my wait, indicated that all charges on my bill were merited, but that she could provide me a discount this one time, and then said something I will never forget. We got a bit off topic in the call and she told me that it was Riverside's policy, when faced with a puppy who had parvo, to only offer in-hospital treatment as an option. This costs several thousand dollars and is the safest but also most expensive form of treatment. But if a customer could not afford this, they may recommend euthanasia but they would not offer or even inform a customer about less expensive treatment options, such as purchasing the saline drip, anti-emetics and antibiotics to administer on their own, because pet owners were not trained medical professionals. \n\nI really just could not believe this had even been said. Think about it. Because the best treatment isn't feasible, you don't offer any others that have a good chance of working? It's basically condemning a puppy to death.\n\nI was sickened by the call. I declined her offer of a partial refund to my last bill and switched vet practices.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:43:12Z","yelp_user_id":"cJ3PnIsfYFhC0RRVdHKbPg"},{"business_id":"YSgPH3iTfSgOM3C7ZxDLLA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:22:47Z","date":"2008-07-02","review_id":"T4g8hIRIf5_cZXFxy-9PqA","stars":3,"text":"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who feels that Riverside Animal has been focusing a lot on tests recently. \n\nI've been going there for about 11 years.

When I got the bill, there was an additional $15 for the claws and $65 for 3 months of flea stuff!

Bookaboom was 12 yrs old, he had been ill many times over the years and had an enlarged heart and liver. The current infection had caused sepsis in his blood, he had a very low body temperature and was severely dehydrated. Due to his age and the critical state of his health we decided to let him go, a deeply upsetting moment, one that still makes me cry as I type this.

Let me set up the story for you:\n\nIt was late, and I just got out of my 20th class as a Penn student. It was raining, but hungry as I was, I knew it was time to try my first food cart in Philly.  My excitement built as I found myself ordering General Tso's chicken from the very friendly lady at The Real Lee Ahn. I proceeded home on the bus, fumes permeating through the bag ...along with perhaps just a little bit of grease that may or may not have rubbed on my neighbor. Finally, I arrived home to devour this long awaited treat. \n\nBite #1- Although the dish didn't look bad esthetically, my first bite into the chicken made me wonder just how long that soggy, pathetic piece of meat was sitting in a steamed container until I was dumb enough to order it.\nBite #2- As I lifted the fork up to my mouth, I caught a whiff of the most ghastly smell that took me a good four hours to actually forget. Upon cutting said piece open, I noted shiny, translucent scales- apparently, there were pieces of fried, rotting fish thrown into this smorgasbord of bad food.\nBite #3- After ridding the dish of all pieces of squishy, fried fish (which was about half!) I went in again, but this time not without cutting it open to double check. To my surprise, the meat was dark and looked like crap. Now I know General's is normally made with dark meat, but this stuff didn't even qualify for meat. If it wasn't squirrel and actually was chicken, I'm convinced it was the rectum (no, not the ascending, descending, or sigmoid colon, but the legit rectum still packed with...you get the point). Following this, my appetite was ruined/destroyed/ravaged. I felt like I needed to shower. I promptly threw everything in the trash and convinced myself to never be daring enough to try a food cart again...or for a month or so. \n\nLastly, doesn't the name say it all? Selling the rights to the Lee Ahn name and then changing their minds and setting up shop as the Real Lee Ahn right next to their competitor over some trivial dispute...what the hell is wrong with these people?

My mediocre review is based on an incident where I wanted to buy a new fixed cog.  They were plenty nice and helpful in choosing the cog size.  I then asked them to attach it.  This is a job that takes literally 2 minutes and which I would do myself; I just haven't bothered to buy a chainwhip yet. Perhaps I'm spoiled, because at my preferred shop, Firehouse Bikes in West Philly, they will do a trivial little job like this right then and there with no hassle.  At Trophy, the guy said I would have to leave my bike overnight or come back the next day, either making an appointment or expecting to leave the bike there for a little while.  And attaching the cog would cost $10--$15. \n\nI had the forthrightness to tell the owner that I would be going with the competition and the courtesy to inform him of the reason why.  Where I lost patience was when he then launched into a lecture on his business model, profit margins, mechanics' salaries and schedules, etc. etc.  I can't remember anyone ever having the gall to try to argue me into wasting more time and paying more money for what he even admitted was exactly the same service.  Great, you have a different business model from Firehouse, and yours seems to work for you, since you're still in business.

But making them listen to the details of that reasoning process is just arrogant and will NEVER succeed in reclaiming a single lost customer.

The tej (honey wine, for all you ill-informed philistines) is so good, you'll think you were in \"Bill and Tej Excellent Adventure.\" The overall experience is so good, you'll feel like you're actually in Ethiopia, except unlike the real Ethiopia, people actually have food to eat! Ok, ok, calm down, I'm just kidding. We should be working together to end world hunger, not joking about it. In conclusion, Zoma gets a rating of \"very legit,\" and anyone who disagrees with that assessment should be legally banned from writing restaurant reviews.  So the next time your friends suggest some other inferior Ethiopian place, the only thing to say to them is, \"Not now chief - I'm in the f**king ZOMA!!!\"","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:57:40Z","yelp_user_id":"LOKBrpZFR_rWiEkuULrLgQ"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:33:37Z","date":"2010-05-23","review_id":"_jHaa0KBN6AlnfL9h6p_SA","stars":3,"text":"Two words quickly come to mind when I think of this place.

I was actually meeting the venerable Maria M. at Melba's. My brother and I got there about 15 mins early and it turned out Melba's was closed for a private party. Taking advantage that we were early I began to scout other places I knew about around the block. There's Billie's Black about 5 blocks up but there was also Zoma a block down. I headed to Zoma to do some reconnaissance. It looked fitting for \"El Mayimbe\" and his guests. When Maria arrived at the meeting spot we all walked over to Zoma. First thing you'll notice is the simplicity of the dcor; the walls in soft pastels with very minimal decorations. This is indeed the soma-like quality of the place. It just eases you into the experience. The bar area was beautifully illuminated. Place really began to fill after 9pm.\n\nThe Food:\nMy first foray into ethiopian eats. We ordered a couple signature drinks. My brother ordered a Harlem Raging Bull ((Red Bull, tequila, vodka and lime) and I had the Blue Nile (Henessy and pure goodness). I personally felt mine was better. Plus, given the spicy-ness of what was to come, the sweetness of the drink made for a perfect marriage in gustatory heaven! Started off with toasted injera to give our taste buds a warm-up. We tried to cover all the basic meat groups. I had the lamb-based Yebeg Alitcha, my bro the beef-based Tibs Wett, and miss Maria the chicken-based Doro Wett. It was all served on a giant white platter on top of a big piece of injera. On the side, elegantly rolled pieces of injera to scoop the food with. Ah, the freedom of eating with just your hands. No dilution of pleasure with utensils! I cannot tell you how generous the portions were. And just when I thought I was out of injera, in came our waitress (almost psychic-like) with a fresh round of the good stuff. The chicken, lamb, and beef were all cooked to perfection. BAM-esque flavor! The only thing is that since the beef and chicken use the same seasonings (berbere) it can seem a bit redundant in terms of flavor. The lamb took care of that! We couldn't finish the entire meal.\n\nThe Service:\nTop notch. Our waitresses had infectious smiles. They were quite personable never shying away from innocent, flirtatious banter but instead offering smart comebacks. I appreciate humor. Prices were quite comfortable.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:17:33Z","yelp_user_id":"xx8qIHqHcu8ixeAhMbTPEg"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T16:51:19Z","date":"2010-09-26","review_id":"2NyFwnn6L68zXfrdUXa5og","stars":3,"text":"Good food & thoughtful wait staff.","updated_at":"2013-03-15T16:51:19Z","yelp_user_id":"onKcBag-P8roN0DtAnO-Gg"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T16:50:48Z","date":"2010-08-24","review_id":"2RTDPgeIe3mK_Qa5kZUenw","stars":4,"text":"Came here when I met my new roommates and it was awesome!\n\nIt was a bit of a hike so we decided to drive.

Located right off of Frederick Douglass Blvd in Harlem, Zoma brings the essence of authentic Ethiopian food in an updated, yet inviting atmosphere. I frequent this place so often that I have become friends with the owner, Henock. He is always so gracious and very accommodating. Not only is Zoma a great addition to the neighborhood, but Henock is also a supporter of the local restaurants and bars in the area as well. He wants the local businesses to do well, which in turn keeps the neighborhood thriving.\n\nWith so much to choose from on the menu, I always stick with the combination platters which serves two people. The platters consist of the vegetarian combination and the Zoma combination. But if you ask the waitress she will customize the platter to your liking. For example, if you are not a fan of spicy food then you can substitute another dish.  One of my favorite dishes is the Gomen Be Siga, fresh collard greens simmered with sauteed beef, onions, green peppers and spices in a mild sauce. A spicy favorite is the Tibs Wett strips of sirloin simmered in a spiced stew with berbere, kibe, garlic, cardamom, coriander, and other herbs and spices. The vegetarian dishes are absolutely flavorful as well. The Atakilt Wett consist of fresh carrots, potatoes, cabbage and onions, sauteed with garlic, ginger and tomatoes in a mild sauce. The Shiro Wett is Ethiopian comfort food and is made up of chickpeas, lentils and peas roasted, powdered and cooked in a berbere sauce with a multitude of spices. These are just a few of many amazing options to choose from at Zoma. But the main staple that ties all these dishes together is the injera. Injera is a flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. The injera acts as the eating utensil, the food, and the plate soaking up the flavors of the food.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and the decor is subtle, but the main draw of Zoma is the food. The ingredients are fresh and the spices are sharp in flavor. Zoma is a real treat for anyone looking for an all around amazing dining experience. Don't expect anything less than authenticity at this Ethiopian mecca.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:48:23Z","yelp_user_id":"TIRAeeaCNo9xKmnKDT0Lxw"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T16:25:27Z","date":"2011-07-19","review_id":"8EgK_oN0eFZySWhG8SmbeA","stars":4,"text":"I *heart* Zoma.

Now I'm not being picky just because I am Ethiopian, there are plenty of restaurants I have tried in the DC area and none even come close to being this bad.  Even my dad who has just recently attempted to cook Ethiopian food made way better food than this place.  The sambusa was the only some what pleasing part of the night.  The shiro, kik, and kay wet were all off in taste; completely unfamiliar to me.  Worst of all was the Tibs.  It was as though someone threw together chucks of meat and just cooked it along side tomatoes, peppers, and onions.  It was a glorified steak fajita you could get off Chili's menu.  Where were the spices?  Where was that distinctive Ethiopian taste.  My guess in the matter is that they don't cook any of their food using Ethiopian butter, but substitute it for plain oil.  Ethiopian butter is a specially fermented butter and contains that purely Ethiopian food smell/taste.\n\nI would never go back, and I hope those of you out there reading this consider finding another Ethiopian restaurant to frequent.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:10:57Z","yelp_user_id":"9JSsr9-pefISE5knpSSKCg"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:11:20Z","date":"2010-03-05","review_id":"aSNoFx88gxTMno1xKUEVhA","stars":3,"text":"Maybe I'm just not a big Ethiopian food fan; this is my first time.

Their vegetarian options are also delicious and healthy to boot.

In fact, I really didn't know what to expect when we decided to brave the rainy night and try nearby Zoma for dinner yesterday (a Wednesday).  Apparently we weren't the only ones, because when we arrived (around 7:45), Zoma was already buzzing and, by the time we left (around 10:30), it was packed.  Despite the crowd, we never felt as if we were being rushed or hurried out to make room for more business (we lingered nearly 3 hours!).  The decor is simple and modern, though the small space is dominated by a full-sized bar which extends across one wall.  \n\nI was grateful, though, that Zoma's modern style did not extend into the cuisine (the lack of utensils on the table was an early clue).  The food arrives in traditional Ethiopian fashion, laid out on injera--a large, thin sourdough flatbread used to pick up bites of the Ethiopian stews.  My misir wett, a thick red lentil stew, was poured on one corner of the injera, while my friend's entree (the potato-and-carrot-based atakilt wett) was on the opposite corner.  The remaining corners held our vegetable sides.  While none of the dishes were initially striking, they were surprisingly addicting.  The misir wett was smoky and complex, flavored with garlic, ginger and berbere (a peppery Ethiopian spice mix).  And just as we'd run out of injera, our server appeared with a heaping tray of seconds.  \n\nIn all, we really enjoyed Zoma: it was ethnic without the kitsch, the service was friendly, the food was good (and not too heavy), and the atmosphere was perfect for catching up with friends.  I also found myself craving leftovers late into the evening.\n\n*Note: Cash or American Express only.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:24:02Z","yelp_user_id":"Kb_FT1ni64SBuOqVl6tVcw"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:32:49Z","date":"2010-07-23","review_id":"H6Ajs6MKaGikOVL1mTVBBA","stars":4,"text":"The best Ethiopian food I've had in the city! \n\nThey start you off with a warm towel to clean your hands ahead of your appetizer.

Ethiopian food is easily my favorite type of cuisine, and I rarely have it; I was so excited for an evening out with good company and delicious food.  Even better that we found this restaurant, just a stone's throw from my apartment.\n\nWhen we walked in, I was floored.  The space is just gorgeous, with really contemporary decor, perfect lighting, great ambiance, and warm, friendly staff.  I was really excited to have dinner here.\n\nUnfortunately, the meal failed to deliver on the what the restaurant's physical space seemed to promise.  My friend and I split a vegetarian combination platter consisting of collard greens, string beans, chickpeas, and lentils.  One of the reasons I am so keen on Ethiopian cuisine is that it is remarkably veg-friendly; a platter of vegetables and beans can be completely satisfying and delicious.  At Zoma, however, I was left rather unsatisfied.  The portion size was really small: our platter was supposed to feed two, but I think that I could have easily finished the whole plate myself.  Our injera -- the soft Ethiopian bread that also serves as the vessel for getting the stewed vegetables into diners' mouths -- was nearly ice-cold and very stiff.  It was unlike any injera I have ever eaten before, and not in a good way.  \n\nThe four courses themselves were very classic and tasty -- though I will mention that the gomen tasted a little more bitter than I would have liked -- but I feel like I didn't get nearly enough of them.  I'm used to leaving an Ethiopian restaurant and feeling too full to walk; while that isn't a great feeling either, paying $30 for a few bites of beans and carrots is not something I want to do or can afford to do with any regularity.  I guess I'm extra-crushed because the place was so lovely when we walked in.  I'll probably try again, but only because it's so close to home; otherwise, I'd go with Meskerem, which is a sure thing.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:35:56Z","yelp_user_id":"ka1_re0A9E7EY-B03A16MA"},{"business_id":"ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:45:39Z","date":"2010-07-27","review_id":"LAIw_f3w6oRYtWXHsddj2w","stars":3,"text":"Delicious and very fresh Ethiopian food, reasonably priced, and a beautiful atmosphere.

My stupid self gets completely disoriented if you put me anywhere between 100th and 168th streets.  Every street/avenue becomes the name of a liberator, third-world style, and then I forget my traffic pattern system and am rendered quite useless.  Let me also mention here that I've been to Society, and Melba's is just across the street, so I knew where I was supposed to go....So I made it waaay late, and Hugo's brother gave me trouble for it, but in the end, I endeared myself to everyone, of course, with my delightful and witty banter.\n\nThe place was really nice and sleek.  The decor was simple with uncluttered, clean lines, the whole nine, and there were some cool pictures on the wall I checked out by the ladies room.  The lighting concept was also fabulous and conducive to many things, so the restaurant is a great choice for most occasions.  This place is great for aesthetics-hounds.\n\nFor drink, I had some tasty, alcoholically green concoction that was reminiscent of a Midori Sour.  For the appetizer, we had some toasted Injera with some spices that was really excellent, and I could have done with that for the entree as well, as Injera is meant as a sort of bread to scoop up the food.  Untoasted, it's really more of a spongy crepe.  The entrees were excellent too, with spicealicious sauces and succulent meatiness, but by the end, I was not so happy with the regular Injera we were given.  However, I was loving that it was OK, even EXPECTED, for me to eat with my hands.  After all, that is the way God intended.  This is one of things I love about NYC: I can do away with much of the table manners I was taught.  In China/Koreatown, I can slurp my soup all day long.  Here, I can eat with my hands.

I'm a fan of Ethiopian food because I like eating stuff that tastes good.  Also, you get to use your hands because utensils suck.\n\nHere's how this went down:  I went to see a screening of a rough cut of this awesome film about what goes on in Emergency Rooms called, \"The Waiting Room\".  (I invite you to check it out once it's officially released).\n\nAnyhow, after the film, I was shepherded to this awesome Ethiopian restaurant in Harlem by three seriously beautiful people one of whom I had met previously and two of whom were new to me.\n\nThe restaurant had white walls with wood beams and made me feel like I was \"in Ethiopia\".  I put that in quotes because I've never been to Ethiopia, but I imagine that really nice people who serve you tons of good food is what Ethiopia is like (along with white walls and wood and stuff).  I've asked around and, in fact, Ethiopia is exactly how I've described it here.  \n\nI guess they also drink Honey Wine in Ethiopia because we started out by splitting a bottle of Tej (yes, it's honey wine, a shocking development I know).  It was really good.  It's substantially different from Mead, which is the thick, syrup-y Viking \u00dcbermensch version of Honey Wine.  \n\nI split a vegetarian combination platter thingy with the beautiful person who was previously beknownst to me.  It was really good.  It comes in a square plate with four rolls of Injera (ie Ethiopian carbs) placed at the corners.  We \"chose\" to go with the lentils, carrots, cabbage, and collard greens.  Two points become important here:\n\n1.  I am again using quotes because I secretly coerced my dining accomplice into choosing specifically those four options because one of the other options involved a thick tomato sauce.  Sadly, I am allergic to tomatoes (oh no Ragu ninjas) [I am a quarter Italian so the tomato allergy earns me the triple word score in this case].\n\n2.  These were not merely lentils, carrots, cabbage, and collard greens arranged in piles also by the corners of the square plate.  They were seasoned, sauteed, and flavorful.  There were definitely moments when our eyes met across the table to see who would eat from which pile.  Seriously, we ran out of Injera and I almost had to throw down Mad Max / Waterworld style for a carb source.  Luckily, the carbonuclear standoff was averted when we were brought more Injera.\n\nListen, the food was really tasty and it was reasonably priced and the portions were fairly large; not all you can eat sushi large, but I left satisfied (read: I ate a lot).

The bartender seemed pretty competent, but the real gems are the 2-person combo platters, I've found. If you're not a vegetarian, Combo B is pretty stellar, and will serve two people for $25. Zoma's dishes have the perfect amount of spice and base, sweet and savory, for my palette. The one disappointment I've ever experienced was the buticha, a chickpea mash: the chef must have thrown in too much flour, because the chickpea was... well, less detectable than I would have liked.

Thank god for the company, otherwise my 40$ + tip spent would feel worthless. A few things about this joint before i head into my review:\n\n- It seemed like it was BYOB. \n-Also, NO CARD!!!... SO MAKE SURE U BRING CASH!  My friend and i had no cash, so i had to walk over to the deli about 5 min away towards to hospital to grab money from the ATM.. not cool!\n- Chips and salsa , acc to their website are NOT BOTTOMLESS. The first batch is complimentary. So, savor the free stuff.\n- Their new location is across the street from the old location.\n- Street parking.\n- Pricey. Around  over 10$ for an appetizer. \n- Clean bathroom\n- 2 floors\n\nLocation: Off the beaten path . It looks like a real estate building in a residential area. Its weird and took a minute for us to realize that this was the location. They need a brighter sign.. actually, they need a sign period. The restaurant name is written on the door. But i guess its good for patrons who want to keep this place a secret-- not too much the owners :)\n\nFood: Not bad.. but definitely not the best ive ever had. Im not a connoisseur of mexican food by any means, but NOTHING compares to Jose Tejas. Even on its worst day, jose tejas ( i think in woodbridge) knocks this place out of the ballpark. That being vented appropriately, the food was mediocre. I got the chicken fajitas. They give you three tiny flour tortillas with rice, guac, sour cream and chicken. The chicken are the size of chicken fingers, they are not cut up to be served in a fajita, so i had to cut it up. However, it was spiced pretty well, i just needed to add salt. The rice and beans were good, but i didnt like the guac. I thought the guac was over processed and dint have enough garlic ( my brother's guac was better than this). It tasted like it came off a shelf (i hope not). The grilled peppers and onions were really good as well.\n\nService: just okay. I was seated in a heartbeat on a table for 2. While i waited about 10 minutes for my friend to arrive, i wasnt rushed at all. There were 2 menus, chips and salsa waiting for me. I tried not to eat the salsa because i read on their website that the firest batch was complementary and the 2nd was about 3$ ( which is the LAMEST THING EVER BTW!!) Oh yea, the pico de gallo ( salsa) was too salty for my taste. But it tasted fresh. Service- nothing special.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE- You lost me at no bottomless salsa & chips oh dear tortugas.

It is highly rated on Zagat's so I had to try it for myself. Regulars to my blog know taht I think ratings on Zagat are inflated and I'm happy to report that Tortuga's continues to confirm my hypothesis. Tortuga's has 2 other locations, 1 in Lambertville which serves alcohol and another in PA. The Princeton location is BYO.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a sketchy part of town. I was a little apprehensive about parking my car on the street but was assured it would be fine. And it was. The resturant itself is a dive. Basic wooden tables, I won't even comment on the decor because there isn't any! I love dives because they are usually the places you can find great, tasty food at low low prices. I love finding places like that. \n\nThe menu was somewhat surprising. I was expecting something more authentic and the menu has some of those but it's a strange mixture of american, tex-mex and mexican. The spicy chicken wings made with habenero are a case in point. They were good, but strange and really spicy - made my lips burn. For the main course I ordered the Chipotle Shrimp which came with brown rice. It was a creamy jalapeno sauce, taste was good but the food was so unbelievably hot (in terms of temperature). It seemed like tehy had nuked the food for ages. It hadn't cooled down for 20 minutes. The shrimp were massive and cooked just right. But why was the food so damn hot? Kedar tried the tacos with Chorizo and wasn't too impressed. He really doesn't seem to like much. BTW, portions are huge.\n\nOverall I would say the food is decent. I've had better Mexican, but if the craving for Mexican with a twist grabs you, this place is worth the occassional visit.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:05:18Z","yelp_user_id":"7lIYTsYHsXiHzZWPEDry_g"},{"business_id":"yTjuYyapvDgTRbMgiYtePA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:12:59Z","date":"2012-02-27","review_id":"6fFbIKg4f7UqHS1PHv4ujg","stars":3,"text":"Without a friend's recommendation, we probably wouldn't have tried this place.

I think we went through half the chips before we even started looking at the menu. We ordered the guacamole to start just because the menu claimed their guac to be the best north of the border. It was good, but they were a bit heavy handed on the salt. For the main, I got the Chiles Rellenos Poblanos. Again, a bit too salty. Everything else was good though. Flavors were there, pork was tender, sides were good.\n\nCan't vouch for the authenticity, but the food was good. The salsa and guac were good, but it's pretty hard to mess those up with fresh ingredients. It's too bad they didn't know how to hold back on the salt.

The tortillas were soaked with the sauce so I couldn't pick it up.

Lived in southern california for most of my adult life and married a hispanic woman whose grandmother stayed with us extensively. A good friend went on to be a central american chef and authority on cuisine from that region. I base my opinion off of these experiences. \n\nTortuga fails in that it does not employ the base approach to food treatment that is found in the region it hails from. Strongly flavored food with a few core ingredients mixed correctly. Citrus, chilis, tomatoes some spices. Maybe cactus or avocado. Sauces/Salsas that are made with rough technique but have deep flavors, especially oaxacan styles. Trotillas, beans, rice...these are all pretty rudimentary tasks and even these are butchered. Even worse, they are ignored and the joke is on us. Cause I swear the business strategy is to prey on the ignorant gringos by jacking up prices (perceived value) and plying everything with cheese and sour cream to hide the really deep flaws. Like an old hooker with caked on makeup. \n\nBut even this can be overlooked...fine..its not authentic. I've been to americanized ethnic restaurants (Indian, Malaysian, Portugese) and have had \"good food\", if not authentic. That I can live with.

Served in crisp blue tortilla shells (I find blue tortillas a gimmick) with a cilantro-tomatillo sauce which was excellent.  Lots of lettuce in the tacos.  \nBeans: some of the best we've ever had--creamy, sweet, yum.\nRice: bright orange and both dry and mushy\nChicken Enchilada: the chicken is a bit overcooked, but the flavour was decent.  I wish I had had more of the tomatillo sauce, which had a nice bit of heat creeping up during the meal\nShredded beef crispy taco: this was more of a stewed beef--and some of the best I've ever eaten.\nChorizo crispy taco--wait, this isn't chorizo!  It's chicken!  I was promptly provided with a crispy chorizo taco with red sauce.

I actually got the sauce on the side and just put a small amount on top of the veggies.  It was out of this world good.  Hands down best grilled veggie pita and best sauce ever.  I actually don't even like veggies all that much but am trying to be \"healthy.\"  It was comprised of zucchini and some other veggies.  It also came with freshly made hot potato chips which I enjoyed as well (only ate a few.) The salad was fresh and delicious too.  My mom got the shopska salad which she enjoyed as well.  I saw another group eating some kind of shish kabob that was hanging in front of them and it looked awesome too.  I am definitely going for the shrimp one with my restaurant.com \"coupon.\"  If you search for coupons, you can get the coupon for 2-3 dollars vs. 15.  I paid 2 a while ago with some promotion.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try.\n\nUpdate: We went here tonight for my mom's birthday to to use the gift certificate.  Everything was amazing.  My mom and I shared two dishes: the zucchini boat with fresh tomatoes, feta, and walnuts and the salmon ala greque (and it's wild!:)) with tomatoes, some kind of lemon dill sauce, bulgarian rice, small pile of veggies, and potatoes with a garlic oil sauce.  Since I loved the taztziki sauce so much last time I got a side to dip the salmon in which worked together perfectly.  We really had a lovely time and were very impressed with the food-and it was nice to taste something different vs. the small old dish at a restaurant.  The only small criticism was the salt level which no one else even noticed.  I use very minimal sea salt in my cooking and so that might be the reason.  Oh and I also didn't like the oil for the bread although the bread was good.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:08:31Z","yelp_user_id":"8eEe_ormN8Wxfs_LpMZqFA"},{"business_id":"ytolCF6oDd28c2x6tAaTYg","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:43:43Z","date":"2007-04-01","review_id":"lLgplm9tFDwX1e5HVaH2XQ","stars":4,"text":"This restaurant is indeed underground, as the name implies.  They have both light meals (appetizers) and main dishes, with an emphasis on Bulgarian specialties such as shish Kebabs on vertical skewers, Bulgarian Hot Rocks (read their on-line menu to find out what this is), and plenty of other, mostly eastern European dishes.  If you go to their web site, turn down the volume on your computer's speaker (music is pretty loud).  They also have a children's menu (but with a rather limited set of foods to choose from), and, as you'd expect with any very new restaurant in town, no liquor license.  \n\nThe furnishings have a feel much like a cafe, rather than a more formal restaurant.  Nevertheless, the decor is very modern and imaginative (glass tables with crazed glass sandwiched inside, rock wall partitions, mirrors with aligator skin frames, modern plastic sculpture, etc.).  The service was very quick.  This is a nice place to go if you want a meal that is somewhat different from the usual fare, but you don't want to go to a fancy place, eat fancy foods, and pay a fancy price.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:52:57Z","yelp_user_id":"ycx9wCjia8X4txgPgMRlmA"},{"business_id":"ytolCF6oDd28c2x6tAaTYg","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:31:35Z","date":"2010-04-22","review_id":"pf1JFWfumQDaPWoanhxRNA","stars":5,"text":"We love the Underground Cafe and go there whenever we feel like a good meal. \n\nWe eat all the bread we can because of the addictive oil with spices they serve it with.

Swati G. was buying so I wanted to go somewhere a little more upscale, but she taunted me to try something new and since I'm always game to try most things once, I relented. I hadn't been there before, didn't know anyone who had been there or even read any reviews. My initial hesitancy stemmed from the cheesy web site and uninspiring menu. I really should learn to trust my instincts.\n\nUnderground Cafe opened about a year ago in downtown Princeton, right across from Ichiban and near my favorite Witherspoon Grill. It's owned by a former Bulgarian professional soccer player, Assen Tchongov. He grew up in the restaurant business with his father owning a number of restaurants in Bulgaria. The food is described as european with Bulgarian influences. You can pretty much smell the smokiness of the paprika in the air as soon as you walk in.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty that night, surprising for a Thursday night (well then again, probably not). We were sat down at a booth I think, not quite sure what to call it. The table was made of green glass. The web site proudly states that it was imported from Bulgaria to create the feel of a Bulgarian restaurant. Somehow I didn't feel like I was in Bulgaria. It seemed like someone's idea of quality decor resembles a cheap eastern european nightclub. A word of advice, if you get to sit at these corner \"booths\" sit in the middle, if you sit at the ends then the table is too far from you because the angles are all wrong. I ended up getting a chair to sit closer to the table. \n\nThe restaurant is BYO, but there is a wine shop around the corner with a decent, moderately priced selection. \n\nOverall the food is decent, though not memorable. The appetizers are definately better then the mains. We tried the following:\n\n- Spinach & Feta Croquettes - excellent\n- Zucchini Croquettes - more like deep fried, greasy zucchini slices. Not good\n- Chicken Paprikas Soup - Was returned after a couple of spoonfuls\n- Mushrooms stuffed with sausage - good\n- Penne Ala Vodka - Ok\n- Hot Rocks - basically your choice of seafood, vegetables and meat (sausage, steak, chicken) searved on a sizzling stone plate. Huge portion. Kind of a fun thing to eat.\n- Moussaka - a dud\n\nWe didn't try desserts because the waiter said \"you guys have eaten too much, you don't need dessert\". What the heck was that? This waiter either thought he was funny or pretty much uninterested in serving. I choose the latter based on his performance throughout dinner.\n\nSo, I've tried it and can now say that I won't be back.\n\nWWW.foodielifestyle.com","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:52:08Z","yelp_user_id":"7lIYTsYHsXiHzZWPEDry_g"},{"business_id":"ytolCF6oDd28c2x6tAaTYg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:49:11Z","date":"2008-10-01","review_id":"z6oKDuiX7JtjHDwhMEUd5A","stars":1,"text":"This place is kind of wierd.\n\nWe passed it a few times, and made Sproket jokes.\n\nWent there for lunch with small group of 5.\n\nThe kebabs were supposed to be good, so all but one at the table ordered them (the other had the tuna sandwich). 2 chicken, one chicken and sausage.\n\nBread was brought down and served with a walnut oil which I first thought was harissa.

The bread rolls were crusty and hot, the paprika walnut oil odd.  \n  \nDrinks came eventually, followed by salads for everyone except the sandwich eater.

For dinner, Cedric definitely has the potential to earn four or even five stars, but the execution didn't match the potential.  \n\nThe Tuna Tar Tar with Avocado starter was excellent (five stars).  The combination of textures and flavors complemented one another.  One main problem with our dining experience is that they were running out of food!  Almost half of the apps/entrees they were out of.  When I ordered from this now limited menu, I was even told that the leg of lamb was out.  I got the duck dish and the GF got a hanger steak (we both had wanted to the steak tar tar).\n\nThe Hanger steak was pretty dam good (4 stars).  The potatoes that came as a side were good on the whole, but they were too satly in both of our opinions. It was juicy, prepared exactly as she asked (Medium, not medium rare or medium well).  My waiter recommended the Duck (said it was his favorite thing on the menu).  I can understand why- it is a good dish with nice flavors and tasty sides.  One thing I didn't like about it, however, was that it was covered with too much sauce and the sauce was a little too thick for my taste.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and every one at Cedric's is friendly and helpful.  I don't blame him because it was the end of the night and the place was busy, but I did have to ask for bread after seeing other tables get some and not being given any for a long while.  Unfortunately, this bread was a bit too tough and (though this will sound picky) I like having olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip the bread in rather than just butter.\n\nThe wine he suggested was fine (a Bordeaux), relatively inexpensive, but nothing to write home about.\n\nDid the small things that went wrong with our meal make it not enjoyable? No.  If I have the choice, however, my suggestion is to come here for brunch rather than dinner.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:35:27Z","yelp_user_id":"FL0cDJZAPcggxhVzopIDhg"},{"business_id":"yue8UWXtQ38ddVn0fqAn0A","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:47:46Z","date":"2012-10-09","review_id":"6aLoqidlW2D3OGF_3aXoHQ","stars":3,"text":"I have mixed feelings from my brunch experience there.\nThe service was pretty bad: they forgot to give us menus and water, we had to ask for it after a 10-15min wait.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a patron and I like the place, but it's not the sort of place where you come away saying, 'Wow, the service was really great there!'. It's more like, 'That was pretty good for Harlem.'. So here's where the kudos come in:\n\nGF and I were out for dinner  there on a Thursday night--prime time, so it's pretty busy (always nice to see). We're eating fairly light and decide to split an app and entree. The first surprise was that the kitchen took the time and effort to split the dishes for us onto separate plates. Unasked for, but very much appreciated. Shows that the waitress was paying attention. \n\nThe second part comes later. Since we've only ordered a couple of things, we decide to splurge on dessert and place the creme brulee. It takes forever for the kitchen to deliver it to us. Not really a big deal because we're not in a rush, but still, it's obvious the kitchen is backed up and needs time to recover. It finally comes and we finish our meal. When the check arrives, the manager leans over and tells us that he's comped us the dessert because it took so long. \n\nNow, I've been in many, many downtown restaurants, and although that same scene has played out more times than I can count, I don't think I've ever been comped unless I've complained about it. And in most cases, not comped at all. So imagine my surprise when a mid-level restaurant--in an area of town not known for great service--takes a financial hit because it's the right thing to do! I think that attention of detail should be rewarded.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:45:46Z","yelp_user_id":"jgSjcA9qi50Drm0hqfA17A"},{"business_id":"yue8UWXtQ38ddVn0fqAn0A","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:11:41Z","date":"2011-11-06","review_id":"8VsMlNukjbYecGfefawJQA","stars":4,"text":"First let me give big props to the previous post by linda c.

And btw, Bad Horse is great but please don't bring your brat there, no one wants that...but by all means continue to take him to Bier or Lido cause those places suck\n\nAs to Cedrics however, it is a wonderful place; small, quaint...cozy even...the staff are friendly and overall it has a very good vibe. While we were there for dinner there was a birthday in the dining room, so it got loud and silly for about 60 secs and then everyone went back to business, sort of a nice mix between campy and fine dining...its kind of hard to explain, suffice it to say it just had a nice, positive vibe to it that most will enjoy.\n\nThe food was very good, especially if you like French food... very rich, well executed, nice flavors and combinations and they have an interesting menu of dishes that are both traditional staples and a few things that are kinda way out there. The staff were attentive and friendly and a pleasure to dine with, its a small and intimate dining room but I never felt crowded or pressured the whole evening and they were quite busy.\n\nAs others have noted, the prices are a tad high ($20-30 mains) for Harlem but the reality is that there aren't really any options for classic French food in the area.

Pity, because the food was great and the service excellent. It's a nice space - although they have crammed slightly  too many tables in. The deal breaker though, is the music. Had we not been there as guests of a visting friend, I would have walked out early on. My husband actually left mid-meal and went and sat in our car outside. To be fair the manager was solicitous, when my husband explained why he was leaving and even offered to run out to the drugstore and buy him some aspirin. This just painfully underscores that he completely failed to get the point though. And if a restaurant manager is not listening to the needs of the paying customer - well it's not ideal is is?

It was a gorgeous day out and if you're looking for an open air dining experience in the neighborhood, Cedric is the place to be. The restaurant is cozy, with about 15 tables, and is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the restaurant facing the street. On a nice day, these windows are swung open giving you a nice breeze and great atmosphere as you eat.\n\nThe service at Cedric is a little slow. After being seated it took a good 15 minutes before a waitress came over asking for our drink orders and another 15 minutes before those drinks arrived. However, the place gives off that vibe and encourages you to relax, enjoy the atmosphere and company, and take your time. They don't rush you out.\n\nFor brunch, I ordered:\n\n    Omelet with Spinach and Goat Cheese\n\nOur food arrived fairly quickly (compared to our drinks) and there was an unanimous decision that is was all very good. I'm a sucker for goat cheese so I wasn't complaining about my meal.

My omelet came with both a side salad and fries which were nothing to brag about - I mean it's just fries and a salad.

But given the prices of the entrees, it is lacking in service compared to downtown restaurants of similar pricepoints.  Perhaps I'm a bit particular, but it is a no-no in my book for servers to reach over guest's heads while they are serving.  It is also unacceptable for them to hand the plates to the diners in a way that diners have to receive the potentially hot plates with their own hands.  No, you are supposed to set the food ON the table in front of the guests, and do it in a way that your arms are not flying over people's heads..  NOT over people's heads and NOT requiring people to hold the plates and set them down themselves.  Also, it is custom for servers to know which guest ordered what dish. A few times though, the server would just plunk down a plate randomly without confirming who had ordered what. \n\nMy friend ordered a dessert that was supposed to come with ice cream and whip cream. The waiter came and said that they were out of whip cream and asked whether that was okay; he would compensate that with an espresso on the house. When the dessert was served, however, there was whip cream, but NO ice cream.  My friend was very disappointed.  She asked the waiter for clarification and he only answered, in a dismissive tone, \"oh, they told me it was one of the creams that was out.\"  I was not impressed by that response.\n\nNot everything about the service was bad though. The same waiter was at times quite patient with our party, since we were bigger (7 people) and some of us were fussier than others.  I asked for a substitute for a side and they very graciously accommodated.  The food was also quite good; people were in general happy with the quality and taste.  I ordered the organic chicken with ratatouille and it also came with a little bit of green salad.  The chicken was very tender and the portion very generous.  I couldn't finish it all.  \n\nAnother thing I commend Cedric for is that there were no children screaming or running around the restaurant.  This is quite rare since parents in \"new\" Harlem can't seem to leave their children behind for dinners.  Bier Int'l is a baby central, as is Lido.  We very much enjoy the grown-up environment that Cedric offers.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:05:19Z","yelp_user_id":"RM9z8bPU0RX4DQRpPc0pVA"},{"business_id":"yue8UWXtQ38ddVn0fqAn0A","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:09:24Z","date":"2012-05-20","review_id":"g_PZNrFovTjk7BnxwCCLHA","stars":3,"text":"I am very torn writing this post. Cedric is a gem and it suits Harlem perfectly. The atmosphere is quaint, but lively at the same time, packing in tables anywhere they can in the well lit, open dining room. I came here on a Saturday with a few buddies for a birthday (without a reservation) and were sat right away. I was impressed at first glace. It was, without question a French inspired restaurant with the way it was decorated. \n\nThe five of us were sat next in the corner near one of the open windows/walls and next to the live music. While I can certainly appreciate being serenaded with live R&B the technical difficulties the musician had definitely took away from the experience. First she sang one song and then left the \"stage\" only to return about 5 minutes later reintroducing herself, then once she finished her song she left the stage again for the same amount of time. When she returned she introduced herself...again. After singing her song we were sure she would leave for a few, but sure enough she decided to stay, but while attempting to move on to another song her mic went berzerk and gave crazy feedback for about 15 seconds, leaving the whole place in agony. I don't know if it was her manager, or part owner of the bar, but whoever it was with her was sitting near us watching and freaking the hell out about her performance, swearing under his breathe. I thought his head was going to blow up. It was hilarious.\n\nAnyway, on to the service and meal. Our waitress was an extremely attractive woman... that's about it. She would bring our drinks over one at a time, I assume trying to not to strain a muscle.. who knows. However even though she would take her sweet time the sangria was really tasty and def did the trick. For apps we got ano order of the mussels, which I have to say were the best I've ever eaten. The sauce was beyond delicious if I were at home I probably would have but the bowl up to my mouth and drank it. For an entre I got the flat iron steak, medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend. So, as I said above I am very torn about this post because the foor deserved 4-5 stars, but the service was just so subpar it makes me wonder if I would go back. I mean nothing terrible happened besides what was said above and the fact that my friend ordered the burger and the waitress didn't bring ketchup so he had to get up and get it himself. Oh and she also didn't bring bread before anything came out, or even with the mussels. Honestly what kind of french restaurant forgets bread?!\n\nSo yeah if you're in the area it's def worth a try.

As a local Harlemite, I am a huge fan of Cedric, and I believe it's just what the area needed.  I was lucky enough to meet the owner, and he was both very pleasant and attentive.  He wants to know that everyone is having a good time.  It's rare that you meet an owner as passionate and concerned about his patrons.\n\nWhere to begin?  I've read some other reviews that complain that the service is slow at Cedric.  That's a poor interpretation of the service I think.  First, understand that everything about Cedric is 100% French.  As one who has traveled to France before and knows many French people, it's my understanding that the French have always been known for taking their time with most things, so as to enjoy them, never rushing.  And that's what you get a Cedric.  You're supposed to become a part of the culture and relax.  No rushing.  Live life.  That being said, the service is outstanding.  The staff were all very friendly and attentive, regardless of the fact that it was a super busy Friday night.\n\nFor starters, I shared the tuna tartar that my girlfriend ordered.  I'm not even a big fan of tuna tartar, but the way in which Cedric seasoned the tuna and placed it on top of delicious guacamole made the dish utterly irresistible.  So try it, for sure.\n\nFor my main course, I had the steak au poivre.  It was absolutely divine, and I highly recommend it.  One of my friends had the lamb (cooked medium rare) which was also superb.  I highly recommend pairing the lamb or the steak with the Bourgogne Pinot Noir.  You cannot go wrong.  We also tried one of the Bordeauxs, although I cannot recall which.  Long night :-)  It was a very good wine.\n\nI cannot wait to return here soon to try so many other things on the menu.

You know, you had the crying baby at 11:30 pm who threw a fork? \n\n2. Who brings a 13 month old to places like Red Rooster? Batalis?? A BEER GARDEN??

Then stay the f**k home, order in from all those fancy restaurants because they will bring you the food or just put your baby in its Bjorn (which I know you have or, ugh worse, its pouch because that's just sooo authentic) and walk on over, pick the food up, but eat at home because trust that all those people at these fancy restaurants you've independently labeled as \"family-friendly\" are all hating you! \n\n4.  Yeah the French do family dining and yea we have French restaurants across the pond here but guess what? Yall ain't in f****n France and if you did bring your American version of family dining over there I'm sure they'd request you to leave. So I guess what I'm saying is -- your baby's not an accessory item, you chose to have it so choose takeout and leave us who prefer dining atmospheres with post-verbally developed people who can control their metabolic functions alone.  Applebees exists for a reason, I hear they have good wings. \n\n5. A 13-month old doesn't \"love\" to do anything but pee, s**t, stare, learn by instinct and suck a tit.

We were handed a menu and instead of being told up front that a bunch of items were missing, our waitress waited until my roommate ordered lamb to be told they did not have any. Her second choice? Duck...\"Sorry...we don't have that either\". After 2 more items were removed from the list...I thought...well, what DO you have? \nThe waitress put in our appetizer order of beet and goat cheese salad and our wine (or so we thought) while my poor roommate whose birthday dreams of lamb or duck were crushed.  She finally settled on the salmon with ratatouille and I ordered the jerk chicken, which comes with fries and salad. I added a side of ratatouille. \nThe beet and goat cheese salad did not disappoint. Beautifully presented and artfully plated, it was the most delicious representation of beets that I have ever had. Just divine flavors. When our waitress refilled our water glasses, we asked if the bartender had forgotten about our wine, which made her quickly admit that SHE had forgotten to put in our wine order and it would be on the house. Fair enough.\nOur meals arrived and they were wonderful. The jerk chicken was evenly spiced and moist. The ratatouille was the best that I had ever had, and my roommate agreed. Her salmon was cooked perfectly and her side of mashed potatoes were creamy and delicate. During our meal, we were told to slide our table to the left so that they could squeeze in a table of four, which was odd, these poor people were awkwardly squeezed in and one person's chair was right up near my ribs. As we finished our meals and sat drinking our wine, one of the waiters came up to our table and made mention that he had people waiting and would need our table. I can understand when people are just sitting there and you have a wait - but there was an EMPTY 4 top table next to us and we had JUST finished our wine! I hate being rushed out when there is no need for it. \nSo, 3 stars...the food for me was worth 5 stars, but not having menu items and not being told in advance, forgetting wine, being rushed out....it just all felt weird. Thanks for the comped wine, but that is not going to earn more stars. Just irritation. Not sure if I will return here.

So far I've been twice. The first time was for brunch. I got the burger and it was a little gamey but still good. French fries were great. The salad came barely dressed, I could hardly tell if there was any on the salad at all.\n\nThe second time I came for dinner. I was a little disappointed that they have a 2 page wine list, but it doesn't specify which are available by the glass. When I asked the waitress, all I got was that they had Merlot, Pinot Noir, Cabernet and one other red. I would have expected a little more information, but that's all I got. I ended up going with the Cabernet, but then was surprised that the glass ended up being $10. That seems pretty expensive for only having the basic wines available with no other choices. would have expected it to be $7-8. \n\nThe dinner I got was great, but it was $26 for the steak. I pay that much when I'm in the west village with great service...not sure why it needs to be that much in Harlem, especially with the service.\n\nAs for the service...The waitress took over 5 minutes to come and take my order (seems like a lot of time for such a small restaurant). I never saw her again after that. The bus boy brought my food/water/bread. I finished my glass of wine about half way through the meal and would have liked another, but no one noticed or stopped by to see how the food was. After I finished, my waitress was still MIA so I had to ask the bus boy for the check (never came), then i had to ask the host for my check. He was very nice and went to ring me up right away, but in helping me, he wasn't at the door and I could see that the owner/manager was annoyed because some people came in without getting greeted...but hey, maybe the waitress could have done her job and he would have been at the door to greet the newcomers.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:04:52Z","yelp_user_id":"0VpkDZhV3Bxmi_hJMKAfEg"},{"business_id":"yue8UWXtQ38ddVn0fqAn0A","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:09:24Z","date":"2012-09-23","review_id":"VzQnnaRVF-rFLMB95izr0A","stars":5,"text":"Excellent French food served with a flair and charm.

It's kinda like a food cart inside; there is coffee so I guess it is a cafe.\n\nIHAC has a sandwich press, which is great if you like paninis, tosted sandwiches or wraps hot. I'm usually happy just eating cold sandwiches, but given the choice I'll opt for my sandwich to be George Formaned. The menu board is full of good looking options and I've tried a few of the sandwiches and wraps to go. The people that work there are pretty friendly which is one of the reasons I've gone back a few times. \n\nUnfortunately I'm always disappointed in my choice by the time I start eating.  I blame the potato chips. I think what happens is when they toss the potatochips into the Styrofoam clamshell with the hot sandwich the chips end up soggy AND the sandwich ends up absorbing the fat and salt from the chips, leaving it tasting like soggy potato chips every time.\n\nThe space itself is as comfortable as the back seat of a Volkswagen with an overheated engine; it's definitely an order and leave kind of set up. The bathroom is somewhere hidden in the International House.  The muffin/bagel selection always looks beat by the time lunch rolls around and is fly fodder that should be chucked after 10AM.

The coffee is easily the worst I've ever had (that includes McDonalds' coffee). I've never met one person who didn't hate it. The pizza station has the looks of an old fashioned brick oven pizzeria, but the pizzas are haphazardly thrown together and drowned in sauce. The guy ignores you if you ask for garlic knots, and generally frowns if you even order from him. The cold sandwich station is decent but the servers there tend to ignore you for a while until they finish conversing with their friends. No \"can I help you?\" or anything like that. I am not sure what to do, so I usually wait until they look at me and then order. Sometimes they continue their conversation, other times they listen and make the sandwich. The hot breakfasts are fine, as are the hot lunches, and if you are willing to wait 10 minutes for some eggs, that's a fine option. The salads are mediocre; go to appletree if you want a better one. The cashiers are always very friendly, which is generally the most pleasurable part of eating here. Finally, the seating area, while old-fashioned and kind of drab, is a good place to eat if all the seats at the pizza place are filled. We all know how these places work. It allows TC to feed it's students as cheaply as possible while giving the illusion of semi-fine dining. In reality, this is crappy food dressed up to look decent. The service staff are often more interested in socializing with one another than they are with serving people. A new food provider and service staff would be a start.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:49:08Z","yelp_user_id":"ivNBr1O6HC41jG3TNhrycQ"},{"business_id":"yw2yc4OlDDf-5g9DcUtpuw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:08:38Z","date":"2010-12-04","review_id":"jMMgzOh150ZHkJyMWhEY4Q","stars":4,"text":"TC cafe always has vegetarian options which I appreciate and the prices are great.

They ask me how I'm doing and whether my last repair turned out satisfactory. People friendly, user friendly, check out their selection and they'll give you ample time to peruse kindly and give honest opinions. Not only that, they'll give you multiple opinions from different glasses wearers. If you're bashful you can try on more pairs than you think, if you're not don't hesitate. If you're in to transitions or prescription sunglasses they carry many of those as well. They have provided me with a case and cleaning cloth every time I purchased a new pair. Not to mention that their exhibits of quirky eye wear models doing poses with some kind of alteration that makes them have an eye for a head or something optical of that manner. They have little toys that kids can play with on one counter, which I did as a kindergartener on with glasses.\nThe hip layout of Modern eye is intensified by a spotless counter sharp over a smooth tile floor, sometimes they have this trance like music playing with a pleasant up beat and mild bass. Once you're in you're completely flanked by translucent lenses and an esher painting of frames. \n\nI definitely recommend them.

The air conditioner could be stronger (I just opened the windows and was fine), and the cable television hardly worked (you are in New York, why are you watching TV anyway? About 20% of the people in New York with Time Warner Cable are having the same issue with cable not working on any given night). \n\nI was checked in by a joyless security guard.

If you can find them, they have a few decent products, but the store itself feels really cheap. \n\nThe biggest problem, though, is the staff in the drugstore (again, the pharmacist sounds great). During one trip, I was trying to grab some toothpaste, and someone was restocking the shelves. No \"sorry,\" no move out of the way, no \"can I help you.\" I literally had to squeeze my arm in front of her to grab blindly for an item. So weird. Another time (the last time I will be going to Hartley), I had something like $9 worth of stuff and only a credit card. Ignoring the fact that it's illegal to set a credit card minimum, I WAS SPENDING $9 AND THEIR MINIMUM WAS $10. The guy said I hadn't spent enough. I told him I'd just put my stuff back and go somewhere else because I didn't have any cash, and he replied in a very condescending tone, \"Just this once.\" Yep, just this once indeed because there is no way I'll be going back.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:34:07Z","yelp_user_id":"E6ftcDxsIX9tx5JlcoNORQ"},{"business_id":"zBsAe3jj1MgtRKdA1zIjtw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:04:07Z","date":"2007-09-05","review_id":"mdB8iQmrV58jOrz_OM3Uww","stars":4,"text":"Finally, a regular pharmacy!

Generally that would worry me a bit, as I tend to think that places that have lines usually have them for a reason.  But we had our choice of tables, and then the full attention of our server.  \n\nEverything we ordered was *excellent*. \nBread comes to the table after drink orders, and every table has its own bottle of good quality extra-virgin olive oil right there so you can have as little or as much as you like for your bread.  Mmm. \nWe started with the Antipasti appetizer special, which was probably the best antipasti I've ever had.  Marinated mushrooms, roasted yellow peppers, crostini, caprese, endive, prosciutto, and fantastic fried calamari--all served to us from a serving plate onto our plates individually and identified for us by our server, which I thought was a very nice touch to the service.  Highly recommended. \nThen had the specialty seafood salad--cucumber, fennel, and tomato with scallops and squid in bread.  A very different approach to salad, but very good.  \nMy entree was a special for that evening--spaghetti squash ravioli with brown butter, pancetta and walnuts in a very light cream/butter sauce.  It was incredibly satisfying.  My date had the pork tenderloin and cauliflour gratin that was on special--also very well prepared and delicious. \nWe weren't going to order dessert until we saw the menu and saw that there was a Nutella semi fredo.  We debated...and finally ordered it and it was AMAZING.  I would definitely order all of these things again, but the dessert floored me. \n\nOur server was very good throughout the night; got us everything we needed without being in the way.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is airy and spacious, warmly lit and decorated in a comfortable, modern style.  Dress code is casual, we were dressed nicely, but there were other patrons there in jeans. \n\nHappy Hour M/T/Th is 1/2 price glass wines, not a bad deal!  (W/F $5 mixed drinks).  \n\nIf I could afford it, I'd go all the time.

I was disappointed with the overall texture of the protein, because what I enjoy so much about tuna tartare...what is essentially the beauty of it in the first place...is that the tuna itself has such a delicate, tender texture to it that biting into raw fish wouldn't gross you out.  To eliminate that delicacy is a shame.  I didn't order anything else, and I haven't been back, but perhaps I will head in to try something else on their rather extensive bar menu and then I will update.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:38:53Z","yelp_user_id":"MxC6vFBs6NGuN1j236413w"},{"business_id":"zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:51:07Z","date":"2008-11-07","review_id":"fSqt-9TSXhM9PtiMR15XkQ","stars":4,"text":"I'm a bit spoiled being this restaurant is right next door to my flower shop.

I usually ate at Tre Bar, but if it was nice out, I would eat outside at the main restaurant.\n\nThe menu is wildly inconsistent, but once you find their best main dishes, you can have an outstanding meal.\n\nApps: \n- Fresh mozz and tomatoes is usually very good. It can be a little salty sometimes, but not many restaurants offer house-pulled mozz, so it's worth trying. The tuna tartare is great, but the fish hasn't always been fresh. I would argue it's worth the gamble, and if it's too fishy when it comes, send it back. If it's fresh, you'll be thrilled - tuna, soy, pickled onions, wasabi, micro greens and toast. When it's good, it's really good. \n- The Panzanella is, in my opinion, absolutely terrible. I don't know what show it was featured on, but it was obviously one that lacks any sort of credibility.\n- The beet salad is ok, but the thought of using feta instead of goat or blue cheese is a little ill-conceived. It isn't robust enough to stand up to the rest of the ingredients.\n- Crabmeat and avacado is very nice. It's not really a salad, but it's a good app option.\n\n\nPizzettes: \n- They have $5 pizzettes in the bar one night a week. I don't think any of them are very good - they tend to be quite bland regardless of the ingredients.\n\nPasta: \n- The fettuccine with sausage sauce is transcendentally good - like absolutely amazing level of good. It's far and away the best dish I've had here. If you eat here once, this is what you should get.\n- They sometime have a pappardelle with rosemary chicken and lemon that is really really good - nice and light. It's not on the menu right now, but it may be a seasonal item.\n- I've found the gnocchi to be too gummy and it just sits in your stomach like cement. \n\n\nThey have a very good wine selection and bartender is knowledgeable about what they offer by the glass. They also offer reasonably priced wine flights.\n\nThe three stars are because of the tuna on good days, the fettuccine with sausage sauce, and the consistently good wine recommendations.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:45:19Z","yelp_user_id":"kKeAw3dthkZFB_yeVSdgeg"},{"business_id":"zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:50:48Z","date":"2010-09-20","review_id":"juaip6pZg4lMHFA9CY_yOA","stars":3,"text":"Tre Piani is an italian restaurant in Princeton, though it isn't quite in Princeton. It's in Forrestal Village off route 1 near Ruth's Chris and Salt Creek Grill. I've been avoiding going to Tre Piani for a few years since a work holiday party. The food was pretty mediocre and I'm not crazy about the location so it usually doesn't enter my consideration set when I'm thinking about italian food.\n\nMy brother was in town visiting from england and we decided to go out for dinner. I wanted something that even my kids would enjoy (10 and 12), though they are pretty adventurous when it comes to food and have decent palettes. Having not planned ahead, we had trouble getting reservations at my first choices of Eno Terra, Medittera and having been to One 53 quite often lately I wanted to go somewhere different. I went onto Open Table and Tre Piani was one of the few places with a 7.30pm reservation available on saturday night, so we ended up there.\n\nTre Piani is a pretty large restaurant scattered over 3 floors with an outdoor seating area. The restaurant is across from the Cando gym and some office space making the outdoor seating seem somewhat out of place. We sat by the empty bar on the main floor. The tables are spaced nicely apart making for a easy dinner conversation. When you enter the restaurant you are greeted by a pretty cheerful older guy, maybe the owner who makes you feel pretty welcome. He walked over and chatted with quite a few diners who seemed like regulars.\n\nThe food itself was better than I had remembered though overall it was pretty mixed. Some items like the calamari were very good - crispy and tossed with a sweet and sour sauce. The tuna tartar was under-seasoned and just ok. For the main courses the tortellini alla bolognese and fettucini with roman style sausage sauce were very good while the osso buco was a little too heavy on tomato sauce, though it was perfectly tender. The risotto side with the osso buco too was decent though not great. For dessert, my son was the only one to order something and he went for creme brulee which was perfectly made.\n\nThe wine list at Tre Piani isn't great. They also have a wine bar next door (Tre Bar) which I've been to a few times. Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of their wine lists. Quite disappointing actually.\n\nService is on the slow side, the time between courses is exceptionally long. While the resturant was busy it wasn't so busy that it should have slowed down service so much. If you go make sure you plan on spending quite some time there.\n\nOverall the food is decent. I would give it a 3 out of 5. If I'm looking for italian food I would choose Eno Terra but Tre Piani isn't too bad an alternative if you can't get a reservation there.\n\nwww.foodielifestyle.com","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:36:50Z","yelp_user_id":"7lIYTsYHsXiHzZWPEDry_g"},{"business_id":"zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:39:28Z","date":"2010-03-13","review_id":"mdo8zZrTmoQ_4bYFqj0aLQ","stars":3,"text":"The food is the only thing that saved this place.

I by no means felt comfortable asking him for a wine recommendation, so I chose that on my own. \n\nI stared myself off with a Homemade Mozzarella appetizer. I'm not entirely sure they can safely call that \"homemade\", but the dish was good overall. DINNER = WINNER. The pasta dish I chose as my main course absolutely  stole my heart. Rigatoni with Filet Mignon Tips and Gorgonzola Cheese. The dish was so creamy and rich and full of flavor. Paired with a full bodied red wine, this dish could take you to the moon. Sadly, the filet mignon tips were cooked poorly. They were chewy and dry, even after sitting in the sauce. Bleehh. Next time, if there is a next time, I will order it without the meat. \n\nInstead of dessert, I opted for a cheese plater .. which was not on the menu. I (hesitantly) asked the waiter if a cheese plate could be put together. He returned back to tell me that it could and that he would bring it out with my guest's dessert. He brought over the cheese plate .. and just walked away. No introduction to what was sitting in front of me, what-so-ever. I later called him back to ask him what types of cheese he served me, and what exactly the sweet jelly-like thing was in the middle. He had no idea (surprise, surprise) and returned to the kitchen to find answers. He came back to the table and attempted to tell me the name of the jelly-like item (I could not understand what he was saying) and said nothing about the cheese. \n\nI rest my case .. enter at your own risk.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:54:34Z","yelp_user_id":"1V-z8TAWKU35ulhKE4qSrQ"},{"business_id":"zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:32:07Z","date":"2011-08-14","review_id":"n0p9QVk6TAbdgA4KvVFrxQ","stars":2,"text":"My family and I went to Tre Piani for dinner on a Saturday night.

By far the best 3/4 pound burger you can get for the price...juicy and covered with caramelized onions, and farm fresh lettuce and tomatoes (and they support local businesses for this).  You can also get it halal just FYI.  Appetizer wise during happy hour, I've had their meatballs which are overly oily and their margherita pizzas which are nothing special...good thing they were about half off.  Note that they have other happy hour specials like 1/2 off glasses of wine, pastas, pizzas, etc on other nights.\n\nCame here for dinner last night and started with a half dozen of their Cape May salt oysters ($10).   They actually gave us 7 oysters, which was a nice surprise (for the informed, a half dozen equates to six).  Wasn't a fan of the cilantro sauce accompanying the dish, but lemon was more than enough flavor for it.  Then shared a humus salad (~$9), which I wish their was more pita bread for...while I thought it was tossed with too much dressing, it very well could have been the fact that my friend had put olive oil in the humus, which I was not used to. I'd get it again.\n\nTried out their seafood mixed grill ($24 - see picture).  The salmon was a bit overcooked and burnt, as was the shrimp, but the calimari (which I though was an onion initially) was perfectly seasoned (although some may say it was salty), and the tuna was seared raw just the way I like it.

He loved the grill-feel that the restaurant kept without compromising their higher-class cuisine. \n\nI ordered eggplant rigatoni with tomatoes, garlic, capers and blackened chicken.. it was really tasty and definitely enjoyed the taste. It was not over-bearing, it was proportional with the other things on the plate and I didn't  need to bury it in lemons or pepper (as I typically have to do in Italian). \n\nAnd finally, the evening ended with my husband FULL, so that I could eat my desert ALONE-- definitely recommend their mint chocolate mousse was deliciiiiiiiious- it was $10'ish but prepare to spend in trepiani.. a dinner for two was around $70 (bear in mind my husband only ordered a burger)... so it is definitely on the $$$ area.\n\nBut, we do recommend it for those in a budget, to at least try the place. \nFor those with money... I'd probably go more often!","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:04:01Z","yelp_user_id":"KVkTYoLE5YkF_8RaAPhMCg"},{"business_id":"zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:41:07Z","date":"2012-04-06","review_id":"zTrd71KXNw-m0o84KB8OGQ","stars":2,"text":"We ended up in Tre Piani on a Saturday night for the amateur Comedy Improv show  (a bunch of Princeton folks, providing 90 min of entertainment for $15 a ticket.).

In college I would just do a walk-in and always had a different stylist.  As that my hair was long, layered and color-free, I never could gauge the quality of the cut - I was happy, the place was nice and friendly.\n\nAfter college I tried many salons in the DC/MD area and no one seemed to know how to cut my fine (yet plentiful) slightly wavy, slightly curly hair.  I went back to Bananas just because I was in town and for the first time in years got a quality cut.  I continued to visit that stylist, and even when I got married I had my entire bridal party have their hair done at Bananas (and I also got my bridal manicure there).  All the updos were lovely, and my nails looked pretty yet subtle.\n\nWhen my regular stylist moved away, the manager suggested I start seeing Kathleen.  Best decision I had made in a long time.  Kathleen totally got not only my hair type, but my personality and style.  I can go in and say, \"I trust you\" and come out with amazing color, a fabulous cut, and a great experience.\n\nThe other stylists are also quite talented - I have had my hair cut by John and Michael in the past and they are both artists.  I like to see loyalty and see stylists who have been there since I used to go in college.  Casey is the owner and she is regularly there, cutting hair, chatting with clients, fully aware of her business.  \n\nBananas moved in the past couple of years to a larger location off Knox Road.  The place is modern, cheery and always clean.  They have brand new tanning beds, waxing rooms, several chairs for cuts and washing, a color bar, and chairs for manis and pedis.  The place always seems busy, but I usually can make an appointment same week.  And a bonus - free parking (almost nonexistent in Downtown College Park)!\n\nI find the prices are reasonable, competitive.  They often do promotions where you can get a discount on services if you refer a friend, etc.  They also have competitive prices on salon products by brands like Pureology and Redken.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:55:40Z","yelp_user_id":"FWvdZfP_637P0fL3Mt9yGg"},{"business_id":"ZcOAdBxxIlEwXnCU8TxPLw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:58:17Z","date":"2011-10-06","review_id":"07voZix5gf0yzWRArQuxuw","stars":3,"text":"I was recommended to this place by my friend's daughter who gets her hair cut there.

I was happy when I left and I didn't have to go home and re-do my hair afterwards because the style looked good.\n\nThere's plenty of parking, its a block off of Baltimore Avenue, but not terribly close to the College Park metro if you are walking.\n\nI'd go back, it was clean and the people were friendly.

By no means was it great or good, but my hair isn't falling out. This review is purely about the service.\n\nAt first everything seemed fine. The stylist was nice enough enough, I got a good shampoo, everyone seemed friendly. However, it soon turned sour. The stylist would not stop talking about how difficult my well maintained, medium length curly hair was. First of all, it is thick, but it is not tangled, and not THAT thick. Second I really don't like being like being essentially ridiculed by someone I am paying to do a job. I don't ridicule others when they come to my place of work and I expect likewise. \n\nInitially I had asked for 2 inches off. She took off maybe an inch. I then said I would wait until after it was styled to decide if I wanted more off. I did and after her accosting me for 30 minutes I decided I wanted it just a little bit shorter, to shoulder length. She tried to dissuade me solely because she didn't want to do more work, which she blatently said in order to get it shorter she would have to cut all of my hair (duh I wanted it even, not the mullet look). She then cut all the way up to my chin, not my shoulder. Ok fine. It's not what I wanted but it is hair. \n\nAfter the haircut (and miserable blow drying job, which left it frizzy and still half curly), she bolted to the desk. When I got there she was whispering to the woman at the desk. I was given the traditional first customer discount which brought my price down to... the price it was supposed to be. The website says $42-47 and after my $5 discount I was quoted at $47. Um what? Yes the woman had charged me $5 for my hair, my medium-length, well-maintained, albeit curly hair, was too difficult. After she moaned the whole time I was already fed up, then her cutting the wrong length and telling me I was wrong, she charged me extra.\n\nThe manager was nice enough, and I'm very unconfrontational (in fact this is my first ever review), but I will NEVER go back and plan to tell everyone else I know. There is no excuse for rude behavior, especially since it is your job and at nearly $50 it's not exactly the cheapest cut ever.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:17:55Z","yelp_user_id":"XWCVeukiSeCqEk_z23pWFw"},{"business_id":"ZcOAdBxxIlEwXnCU8TxPLw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:54:57Z","date":"2011-04-20","review_id":"9CFLxoc_-jXYl8EhdetLaQ","stars":5,"text":"I've been going to Bananas exclusively for my haircuts for several years.

I would say one would have to be comfortable with going to Harlem and being in a very foreign-seeming setting to enjoy this place.  There were tables of Senegalese hanging out, socializing over food and drinks, really a fun experience to sit in the midst of this.  A casual atmosphere.  The waitress was very quick, attentive, and nice (and we were two women - I see some reviewers recommend going with men to get good service), and the food was great.  I had lamb with rice, with stewed onions on the side (and an extremely hot little green pepper on top, be very careful!), and my friend had the grilled whole talapia fish.  The food was very tasty and fresh.  I love the mix of spices used in West African food - very flavorful without being spicy.  The check came quickly.  Everything is very affordable, for New York City as well as for the size of the portions: $11 for my dish and $13 for my friend's fish, if I remember correctly.

The genteleman's english wasn't the best but I was able to communicate with him thanks to HS french. I order some tap water and of course he brought out a bottle of Poland Spring, I was a little ticked off about this but let it slide. \n\nMy friend and I both order the Lamb Mafe, it's a peanut based lamb stew over rice. Unlike many of the other people who reviewed this place our food came out very promptly (we were the only 2 patrons in the establishment which might have something to do with it).

At the top of the stairs, the Ivy League university of Columbia, with its proud old buildings and campus courtyards. Young people scurrying this way and that or tanning in the lawn. Three minutes later, at the bottom of the stairs, one is thrust into the very different atmosphere of 116th Street, a distinctly West African part of New York City.\n\nThe noises are different, louder. The accents are French, and Wolof, and Bambara. The colors are brighter, the clothes flashier, and the people more sensual. The smells are sweet and spicy, and very alluring.\n\nAs the sun was setting to the west over Morningside Park and Columbia University, we decided to settle into a popular, yet cozy restaurant. My apologies for the photos, the interiors had almost no light. It was not the eyes that were necessary for this wonderful eating experience though. And how can you go wrong with an eatery that boasts such amenities like a coat check, a carryout window!, and even a \"grand\" ballroom downstairs!\n\nAt Africa Kine Restaurant the focus is on the cuisine of Senegal and is not so aspiring as the name might allude to, but that always equates to better food, as pan-anything restaurants are thoroughly mediocre in everything. And let's be honest, a menu with all the food of Earth's most diverse continent would be nothing short of insane.\n\nThe women serving us are beautiful, and beautifully wardrobed, in very bright dresses native to Dakar. We have many questions about the food, and all are answered with depth and friendliness. We are disappointed that the national dish of Thiebu Djen ($10) is only available at lunchtime, but are more than satisfied with our eventual selections, starting with the Poisson grill\u00e9 ($11), which was served with an excellent onion relish/sauce, part mustard and part pepper spices. The fish was obviously cared for, as every morsel inside was tender and marinated to perfection.\n\nOur other dish was Dibi ($11), grilled lamb also served with the same sauce. Unfortunately it turned out too tough and required a lot of jaw work. I will look forward to going across the street another day to the Dibiterie Cheikh, which sounds more promising in the world of Dibi.\n\nThe dessert menu was less than exciting, so we decided to take our search for sweets to the nearby candy stores catering to West African sweet toothes.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:43:31Z","yelp_user_id":"Ygr8IFuKLQU27Te5_Kl_4A"},{"business_id":"ZcTI78WOKE-iLAzAGccOvA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:35:47Z","date":"2012-06-03","review_id":"fafcIIkhQAwa3Dw6LAZpKA","stars":3,"text":"The food was good, A LOT OF FOOD!

I had a layover there once, and it seemed like a cool place. \n\nAfrica is a world of wonder. If I could, I'd spend all my days traveling there. But since that's impossible, I have to settle for eating at one of NY's African restaurants, in this case Africa Kine, a Senegalese joint on 116th Street in west Harlem. \n\nThe dining area is located on the second floor. It's nothing fancy but the wood-and-brick interior, with art on the walls and big curtains on the windows, is soothing. African tunes play softly in the background. \n\nI grabbed a seat in a booth by the window and settled into a good read, one that takes place in Congo. For a starter I could not resist Nem ($7). These Vietnamese spring rolls -- which reflect how other french-colonial cultures emigrated to Senegal -- were served with a spicy fish sauce, along with lettuce and sliced carrots for wrapping. They were excellent! \n\nMeanwhile, I noticed the TV was turned to the Olympics and when a runner from troubled Zimbabwe won a semifinal heat in Track & Field, a few customers cheered quietly. \n\nOn to the entrees, where I had a tough time choosing. There was the Pintade, grilled guinea fowl served with eggs and seasoned onions....hmmm, perhaps not...I've seen how cute guinea fowl are, running like crazy men along the sides of the dusty African roads, and I could not in good conscience eat one. Too bad it wasn't Friday when Soup -- a cow foot with vegies -- is served.\n\nI settled on dibi, a dish of grilled lamb served with a salad, a side order (fries!!) and seasoned onions. The lamb had a charcoal-taste, smoky, but it was a little tough for my taste. Still it was pretty good, plentiful and quite the deal at $11. I washed it all down with homemade ginger beer. \n\nAfrica Kine was an interesting night out. I wouldn't necessarily take a first date here but it's a worthwhile stop on your culinary tour of Manhattan. The service is a bit slow but, hey, that's the way things work sometimes in Africa. \n\nSomeday I'll definitely make it to Dakar.

When you arrive at the restaurant you enter a strange run-down vestibule area and then walk upstairs to a restaurant that is in serious need of a renovation (bad economy or not they should really consider doing something). I would definitely recommend avoiding the bathrooms as they are in even more need of a makeover. On the plus side avoiding the bathrooms should be fairly easy as you will not get refills of water, which I actually don't think you'd want because if I had to describe the water in one word it would be 'thick'. I don't know what this means and I don't want to give it too much thought but seriously that water was thick yo. \n\nI've read reviews that the service at Africa Kine is incredibly slow, but surprisingly it was quite speedy when I went with my friends. We ordered a plate of plantains for the table which were pretty good - not too greasy, but a bit unevenly cooked. I had the chicken kabobs with salad, onions and cream sauce. The chicken kabobs were quite good - nicely flavored and all white meat. I was not a fan of the onion salad nor the cream sauce but I believe that was more of a personal preference. The salad was....a salad....nothing exciting to report at all. It was fine. \n\nThough we got our food very quickly, we were not so lucky with the check. It took over 10 minutes for us to get our waitress's attention and when we finally received the check, the prices were different than on my friend's menu. \n\nI suppose I should have tried a more typically Senegalese dish, but based on what I had I do not plan on going back uptown to Africa Kine anytime soon. The atmosphere, or more accurately the total lack of atmosphere (and generally feeling of uncleanliness) will most definitely prevent me from going back.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:54:00Z","yelp_user_id":"zojhPyzy3dN_JB4S_QyTfw"},{"business_id":"ZcTI78WOKE-iLAzAGccOvA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:18:53Z","date":"2012-07-24","review_id":"ZBu1_wknpsQT9aQgHlHsbg","stars":3,"text":"Once you get pass the lack of service from the waitresses who take forever to serve you, you get your food and are finally happy that you made the trek to Harlem.

However, if you work at EssDaySpa, the correct answer is apparently C.  (Okay, okay, there was no spitting, but still.....)\n\nWorst. Manicure. EVER.  \n\nI think it was the receptionist who ended up doing my french mani, given the way she seemed to be trying to simultaneously man the front desk, take payments, arrange bookings, bark orders at her co-workers, etc.  She rushed through the process and her work was haphazard and slapped on.  Add to that the fact that she seemed determined not to waste a fresh bottle of clear polish for my mani -- absolutely STUBBORNLY determined to gather the coagulated, stringy goo in the old bottle and somehow transfer it to my nails -- and you can probably imagine the results.  But I'll describe it for you anyway.\n\nFrench manicures feature painted white tips with a clear or pale pink sheer polish on top.  MY french manicure features topography similar to a small mountain range; little white freckles on the nail beds where the 'manicurist' accidentally slopped the white tip color (she was in a hurry -- no time to wait for things to dry!); and today, the morning after, parts of the paint job are already lifting off the nail bed.  And the piece de resistance?  Some of the nails on my left hand feature delicate little lines, thanks to the fact that the tips of her hair dragged through the wet polish while she was working on me.  \n\nFull disclosure:  Thanks to the generosity of a lovely former work colleague who treated me to my mani, I did not actually pay for the crappy results now displayed on my fingertips. So this review isn't motivated by feelings of being ripped off.  It's motivated by the desire to warn strangers about this joke of a joint, and general irritation that I have to go buy a big bottle of polish remover to get this mess off my hands before I go to work tomorrow.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:42:40Z","yelp_user_id":"c0dGxYrevPmgMxS5rn1DEQ"},{"business_id":"ZD1DHDayBFgjtcWPvUnlyw","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:21:37Z","date":"2011-05-05","review_id":"fJBADXQLJ3hAZkQwGTRBeg","stars":4,"text":"I cheated on my nail salon just to get my brows done here.

I couldn't find any other reviews for this one, so I will post my experience here.  The spa is in a convenient location not too far from my house and there is plenty of parking.  There's also a few restaurants nearby for lunch with friends before or after.  I was really hoping that some of the negative reviews would be inaccurate or exaggerated and that this would be my new go-to spot for pedicures and such.\nI went during lunch hours and the place was empty.  There was a lady at the desk and instead of being friendly, she asked \"What do you want?\".  Maybe I should have taken that as I sign to leave, but instead I responded with \"a pedicure\" and picked up a brochure.  She instructed me to pick out a color and another girl began to get a chair and foot tub ready.  \nI have to admit, the chair was super comfy and everything was really clean.  Overall, the atmosphere was pretty relaxing.  My complaint would be that there was no where to put my purse and I found it strange there weren't any magazines anywhere.  Not too big of a deal; I don't mind placing my purse on the floor and I can bring my own magazine.\nNow onto the pedicure... The girl started by \"selling\" me all of the extras.  I told her NO several times and she continued to insist.  I shouldn't have to say no five times and then open the brochure and point to the services that I want.  Finally, she understood and began the \"basic\" pedi + hot stone foot massage.  My feet soaked for maybe two minutes, then a quick scrub, then she clipped two out of ten nails!  Only two!  The big toe on each foot.  She didn't even file any of them or work on my cuticles before adding the clear coat.  What's the point of having the service done if they skip 3 steps?  After the clear coat, she did one coat of red and didn't follow up with a second red coat or another clear coat.  When nails were drying, she told me that they were dry and pointed me to the register.  At the register, I had to explain my charges to the lady and again she was rude.  I asked to leave the tip on my card and she said \"you leave cash\".  I had cash, but asked if I could leave it on the card instead, again \"you leave cash\".\nI'm giving three stars because I really did enjoy the hot stone foot massage and I didn't think that $7 extra was too expensive for what it was.

AWFUL! AWFUL!\n\nThis place is absolutely horrid!  I took my boyfriend to get a pedicure a couple of weeks ago and it was terrible.  First off, the lady at the reception desk was pretty unfriendly as we came in.  Immediately telling me to pick a polish before she even knew what we were there for.  I told her that we both wanted pedicures, she begins repeating \"It's extra for him! It's extra for him!\".  I say, fine (as it wasn't a problem).  She rushes us back to the spa chairs.  The young lady who did my pedicure was alright.  She didn't provide her name and when I asked her she acted as if she didn't hear me.  My pedicure was adequate, not good, not great, but adequate.  My boyfriend's on the other hand was terrible. It just so happened that the lady who greeted us was the one who did his pedicure.  She did almost nothing.  I was so ticked because I didn't look at his feet before we left as he was done before me (no polish).  When we got home, I looked at his feet and immediately called the salon and asked to speak to a manager.  They scurried and said he was gone home for the day.  I explained the situation and since they didn't ask my name or tell me theirs they only recognized me by the amount of tip I gave the two ladies.  Oh, had I known his was so bad, I wouldn't have tipped his pedicurist until she'd actually done a proper pedicure.  His feet weren't pumiced, his nails weren't buffed or filed.  She only clipped his toenails and washed his feet!!!  They tell me to come back the next day for ME to get a new pedicure...um, I didn't want one for me, but for him.  So the next day I call back to speak to the manager who said his name was \"Ethan\".  Ethan tries to get me to come in right away, but the problem was neither of us live in College Park and my boyfriend has a pretty busy, high pressure work schedule so coming in during the week wouldn't work, hence our coming on a weekend (and they were NOT busy).\n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER return to this establishment! Nor would I recommend them.  Why is a man's pedicure more when they don't do a much?  Also, they taught me NOT to tip until AFTER you see the work they've done for the other people with you.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:53:16Z","yelp_user_id":"vOWTEmcaGvE-xjTdhUFisw"},{"business_id":"ZD1DHDayBFgjtcWPvUnlyw","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:30:18Z","date":"2010-10-12","review_id":"S4IO7lqIjGgvLXZf_1QKCw","stars":1,"text":"The guy barely spoke english.

That has changed BIG TIME!\n\nI live and work in the area, when I attended for their grand opening, I recommended the place to ALL of my friends who live and work in the area as well!!  The staff was very friendly, took their time to ensure you were getting great service, and most importantly the salon was super clean!!  My friends agreed!! It was the local place to go!!\n\nAs time went on (in a matter of a couple months actually) the service went way down hill.  One when you walk in the door they no longer really greet you, you kind of just stand their hoping they will finish their personal conversations and notice you!!  I get that its a salon and when you don't have any customers sure feel free to lounge around on the pedicure chairs in your lil group and chat and eat... BUT when you do have a customer ugh I dunno it may be a good idea to make them feel welcomed??? But what do I know?..\n\nAlso when someone FINALLY acknowledges you..... they are very short with you ask you what you want!! Most of the time I simply go there to get my eyebrows waxed.... (every 2 weeks)... and I suppose that is NOT good enough for them because they catch an attitude and point to a filthy room for you to go lay down in.....then they proceed to tell you what you NEED.  you need ur mustache waxed!! (excuse me, I am a female and I take offense to that!! one I am a white female and the couple of little hairs that are above my lip are BLONDE and unnoticable....) not to mention I didnt ask for that.  I will tell them no thanks, and then they catch an attitude and take it out on your brows!! Ripping your skin right off (never used to be that way)... sometimes they even pick up my hands when I am getting my brows waxed and will say you need a manicure.... :(\n\nWhen I do go to get a mani-pedi...... they always try to UPSELL to spa mani-pedi which is significantly more.... and of course their a business so I get that they are trying to upsell.... ONLY problem is.... they dont tell you that its more expensive, or anything... they JUST start doing it.  I go in and ask for a mani pedi, pick out my colors sit in the pedicure chair, and then they will put the parafin, etc on you....and just do it.... then when you get the bill its ridiculous the pricing when you ask about it... they say you didn't say NO! And I say you didnt tell me what you were doing, or that it wasn't included in the regular pricing etc...once I learned i passed that around to my friends... I did continue to go a few more times, hoping that maybe it was just an off day or something...but NO dissapointed everytime I left... and after learning about the spa mani-pedi upsell, i would say to them just a regular mani-pedi...they would catch an attitude and do a TERRIBLE job.... absolutly terrible... I could paint my nails better with my eyes closed using my teeth.  Honestly... I try not to complain.... and I am the type of person that would try to offer suggestions to help fix their service... but they didn't care or want to hear it.  I always tipped.... even when I shouldn't had....thats just the type of person I am ... but now that i think about it I really shouldn't have I was treated rudely, and the job done was terrible.\n\n\nIt really disapoints me that their service declined SOO much.  My friends and I have all discussed this several times, and we all found new salons!!... Just disapointing that it had to go down that way.... From the bottom of my heart, my review is 100% accurate.... I highly do NOT recommend this place what so ever!!\n\nP.S. Not to mention parking in that shopping center isn't easy anyways!!

Kami is a new food cart on the Drexel campus that's bright red in color with a caricature of a duck wearing a chef's hat and holding a cooking spoon. Kami translates to \"god\" in Japanese. What did Kami's owners mean by that? Enter the bugogi kimchi cheesesteak with your choice of provolone or cream cheese. At the suggestion of a fellow food reviewer, I got both. I opened the foil wrapper. It smelled really good.  I sunk my pearly whites into the most tantalizingly juicy sandwich I've had in a long time. The hoagie roll was pillowy soft like the buns used at The Spot. The marinated meat was perhaps the most tender meat I've ever, ever, ever had from a food cart or sit-down establishment. The mushrooms and onions enhanced the beef's flavor. Only a sparse amount of kimchi was used, but it was just enough to give the steak a little kick. I didn't taste the provolone, but I did taste the cream cheese and it really gave my cheesesteak an interesting texture component as well as curbing the spice of the kimchi. What a great combination. This is hands-down the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten. Now I know what Kami refers to. This is God's sandwich... for just $7.50. The free salad was a nice touch. Kami offers only three menu items - chicken bulgogi, bibimbob, and bulgogi kimchi cheesesteak - ensuring specializaton and high-quality preparation and ingredients. I wish it wasn't Friday because I'd love to go back there again for lunch tomorrow. In my earlier review of The Spot, I mistakenly believed that Kami's owners were somehow related to them. They're not. \"They helped get us started,\" the young woman manning the grill at Kami said. The cordial, older woman taking food orders reminded me of the same setup as The Spot. Having a separate money handler and allowing the cook do what he or she does best is a winning formula. Both Kami and The Spot are setting new cleanliness standards for food carts. For this reason, you can't call them food carts anymore. The more proper term should be mobile kitchens. Kami is a frickin' awesome mobile kitchen.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:19:22Z","yelp_user_id":"5kcLlhJPLJL_GLwrAdbZAA"}]},{"business":{"business_id":"ZijcWgADCYVwLOOGPkd3tw","city":"Philadelphia","created_at":"2013-03-15T06:41:07Z","full_address":"2301 Walnut St\nRittenhouse Square\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103","latitude":39.9511,"longitude":-75.1785,"name":"Rite Aid","open":true,"photo_url":"http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/924a6444ca6c/gfx/blank_biz_medium.gif","review_count":9,"stars":3.0,"state":"PA","updated_at":"2013-03-15T06:41:07Z","url":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/rite-aid-philadelphia-28"},"reviews":[{"business_id":"ZijcWgADCYVwLOOGPkd3tw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:51:54Z","date":"2012-07-31","review_id":"_FTuNVMhAiloiXA7thlm8w","stars":2,"text":"Man, this rite-aid is just the worst.

I originally ordered ravioli stuffed with truffles and cheese; however, owner/chef/waiter man came back and informed me that he would not permit me to order that item because they didn't look very tasty to him. I swear, it happened just like that. So I got ravioli stuffed with mozzarella instead, smothered in artery-clogging goodness (cream sauce). My dad got a slightly spicy tomato-based dish that I thought was fantastic, although I didn't try the chicken, being a vegetarian and all. \n\nWe finished up with a chocolate cake that was, quite simply, divine.

We made a reservation, having seen on these reviews that they had very limited seating. Limited was definitely the optimal word; there were 8-9 total tables for 2 in the whole place! We loved that it made the whole experience much more intimate. The restaurant has a very rustic feel: exposed brick and intimate lighting. \n\nThe service was equally excellent. Three men controlled the entire place, simultaneously serving as the waiter/maitre d', cook/waiter, and busboy/spiderman (no joke! he scaled the walls in the back to a pantry hidden in the ceiling!) The waiter/maitre d' came over and described the specials to us, recommended wine pairings, and was generally very helpful and accomadating. He even sent over a free dessert after we paid the check since the dessert we had wanted had been sold out. \n\nThe food was SOOO good. We had the special ravioli appetizer, which was cooked perfectly and had a great sauce. We then each tried one of the special entrees...I had the steak, and my girlfriend tried the chicken. Both were excellently prepared and seasoned. The only complaint we had were my girlfriend's green beans, which had been overly seasoned. That one grievance was easily forgotten in light of the rest of our evening!\n\nThe waiter/maitre d' even invited us to come to their expanding party in a few months when they break down the walls.

While the food was good, I was freezing half the time and crying the other half.  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is tiny, as other reviewers have mentioned, and seats only about 12 people.  It's like being in someone's apartment, as you can watch them making your food in the also tiny open kitchen.  The farmhouse decor is pretty awesome.  The downside of the small space is twofold:  1) on a freezing night, the effects of the door opening and closing are hardly remedied by the curtain in front of the door and 2) the smoke from the food was just killing my eyes.  Granted, I get cold easily and have sensitive eyes (just a minute of chopping an onion will make me tear up), but still.  I couldn't really enjoy the food because I was alternately shivering and weeping.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, is very good, as is the service.  The main chef is the waiter, as well, and he will sit down at your table to discuss the specials for the night (there were MANY last night - almost like a whole additional menu).  There is a very affordable wine list, especially by the glass ($6-$9).  The food took a while to come, probably because we were the first ones there for the night, but they did give us a free small dish of bean chili - yum.  No one else really came in until around 8 PM, so we had the place to ourselves for a while.  The pesto shrimp pasta appetizer was very good, as was the crabcake.  I had a special red snapper with beurre blanc sauce, which was excellent.  The cous cous that came on the side was tasty, but the green beans were covered in some kind of pepper that was too spicy for me.  The dessert was okay.  We got the cookie with ice cream on top, and the chef substituted chocolate sauce instead of white chocolate sauce on top because we asked (who likes white chocolate anyway?).  The cookie was not so great, but the ice cream was good, as was the Valhrona chocolate.  \n\nI'd come back to Voza, but probably only when it gets warmer and they can keep the door open or I can sit outside.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:01:00Z","yelp_user_id":"Q7u3rC31LFQQ6nPqqojMkg"},{"business_id":"ZiLCt6uZlGY61roYdfeqWA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:13:05Z","date":"2009-04-08","review_id":"iGGBZOHvPhHovxBwYlOkhQ","stars":5,"text":"Okay, first off, the staff are awesome and invited us to their expansion party when the construction is finished.

Our glasses were never empty! \n\nThe food that comes out of that impossibly tiny kitchen is heavenly.  Our complimentary amuse bouche was a very good spicy black bean soup. I tried the special vegetarian entree of the evening (buttery carrots, string beans, cream of spinach, mushrooms and garlic mash) and each item was cooked perfectly.  So many vegetables has never been so satisfying! My friend's tortellini in a vodka sauce was amazing as well.  I could eat that sauce with a baguette all day, any day.\n\nThey are planning on expanding in May so they will have a back dining room and garden/patio and jazz on Saturdays once the weather warms up.  I certainly hope they also expand the kitchen since I'm sure there will be line out the door for this place!

I felt compelled to return after a brief hiatus to continue being awesome.\n\nHere goes...\n\nHole in the wall, seriously don't know how the owner saw potential in this block and neighborhood but seems to attract via word of mouth.\n\nThe decor is subdued, romantic, dim lighting, cozy, rustic. The space itself is tiny. My bedroom that fits a twin bed and a small closet is bigger. It's open kitchen, meaning it's not behind the scenes. It's about the size of a closet and truly a prime example of making the most out of nothing.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:30 pm on a thursday night (tonight) -- it was empty. By empty I mean the other 5 tables were not occupied so a table for two is enough to make the place feel packed (see my tiny restaurant note above)\n\nThe overall experience was both good and bad. Let me explain..\n\n= GOOD =\n- Good food\n- Nice waitress\n- Cute baby\n- Free lentil soup\n\n= BAD = \n- It was only 6:30 pm, how could you be out of a mixed greens salad and two soups on a cold night?\n- The free lentil soup was given because the place was cold. Was pretty good, smoky flavor, too much black pepper.\n- The snapper filet was tiny, like the restaurant. They should state if it's a whole fish or the size of my palm. Snapper was over peppered. They are pepper happy here.\n- The red wine was extremely chilled (because the place was cold)\n- The waitress, whom I presume was the owner's wife, did not turn on the heat because she didn't know how. It was until we left that she put two and two together and said \"Let me ask one of the workers\"\n- We were not offered dessert\n- We were given the check without requesting it\n- Portions were small. We got 7 asparagus each (not even full size)\n- Some items were overpriced. $14 for two ravioli's? I understand it's a special, but does it make it more special when it's a limited serving? With the high price and small portion, you'd expect this in a high end restaurant -- not a hole in the wall mom & pop shop.\n- Waitress' crying baby. He's cute but distracted too much from our intense love making conversation. If I don't get any tonight, it won't be of surprise.\n- Cash only. Cash only restaurants should make a large notice on the menu or be told prior to seating so we can have the opportunity to go to the atm BEFORE eating. If it's cash only, should be BYOB.\n\nI understand there are off nights. Tonight was an off night. Probably the owner left his wife to run the place and babysit at the same time. Good food (most important factor for me), but wasn't enough of a great experience to think about coming back.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:15:36Z","yelp_user_id":"Z8dwA-uR1JEpBN4awRhcnA"},{"business_id":"ZiLCt6uZlGY61roYdfeqWA","created_at":"2013-03-15T07:38:04Z","date":"2007-01-20","review_id":"r8zX05SrYRrUiy3nawcUwA","stars":4,"text":"This tiny new neighborhood restaurant features a cozy atmosphere with heavy doses of wood and exposed brick, and a small decorative loft.

My puny snapper filet and my friend's half dozen scallops were all salted and seasoned to DEATH. Accompaniments included a dozen green beans each (again, coated in red pepper flakes), accompanied by rice and couscous that we are convinced came out of a 'Far East' brand box (my friend swore he had made that particular mix before).

I started with a Dock Street Rye IPA which I really enjoyed, and went with the sesame-encrusted tofu for my meal.  I'm not a vegetarian and don't normally order tofu, but it sounded intriguing.  The tofu was soft and light (not chewy and tough), crusted in a crispy sesame shell.  The flavoring on the asian-style vegetables was quite tasty too.

The waiter suggested his favorite and this turned out to be an excellent call.

The decorations are laid on pretty thick, and it's a great conversion of a house to restaurant without losing any of the charm. The service was swift and pleasant throughout the meal.

Surprisingly, White Dog wasn't even close to full at 11am on a weekend.\n\nI've heard complaints about the prices here, but I found it in line with other brunch places. The exception is the drink menu. Bloody Marys and mimosas for $9 are just far too high. I stuck with coffee for the morning, and was happy with the fresh brew they kept pouring.\n\nLooking over the menu, there were several good options, but I landed with the steak and eggs. The dish had a good presentation, and overall I was satisfied with my choice. My only complaint was that the texture of the steak, in fact I question whether it truly was steak. It seems like a roast that was cut into strips before being topped with the other ingredients. Nonetheless, the dish was tasty and satisfying. Quinn ordered an omelet that came with mushrooms, onions, spinach, and smoked cheddar. She loved her option for brunch and the sample I had was good. She also opted for a side of extra crispy bacon, and it was cooked perfectly to her specification (although not to my taste).\n\nBottom Line: There's not enough going on here to make me want to make the trip regularly, but I do believe that White Dog Cafe is serving up the best brunch in West Philly.

I also really used to appreciate the service, which was solicitous without being pushy. On my last visit, I was very disappointed with the service, pricing, and food. Disclaimers: this was an off-time (late Wednesday afternoon), so I haven't seen the new dinner menu. \n\nWhite Dog's lunch menu seems to have changed to fancy bar food--quesadillas, burgers, \"gourmet hot dogs\" (?) , and only a few veggie options. For a lunch menu, it was quite overpriced ($13 for a small tofu sandwich, $11 for a quesadilla that included only three small slices). And that's where the bad service began. My partner and I--both people who dine out quite a bit and are used to surprises, gaped when the quesadilla arrived. It was that small. When he asked if that was the standard lunch portion, the waitress asked, \"Anything else I can get you today?\" and flounced away. She didn't seem to realize that we had voiced a critique. That was the moment for her offer him salad, fries on the house, or at least to go to her manager to mention there was a complaint.

Their Crab & Spinach Benedict is scrumptious!  It was served with salad and home fries, so I'll write this review in sections.\n\n1. The Benedict itself: Two perfectly poached eggs atop some crab and spinach on half a toasted bagel.  Topped with creamy hollandaise.  It may not sound super amazing (or maybe it does!), but all the flavours combine wonderfully for a really tasty breakfast.  The crab is great in there.  All of it tasted not only delicious but also GOOD and healthy.  White Dog says they use only the best, local, organic ingredients and I believe it!  The effect: a little indulgent but also comforting -- it made my body feel good.\n\n2.  Watercress Salad is a delight!  Actually, this salad was the star of the show, overtaking the Benny.  Fresh watercress, lightly dressed, chopped red onion, capers, cherry tomatoes -- the salty savoury bits were refreshing with the slight bitterness of the springy watercress.  This watercress salad was sheer joy and I'm not even much of a green salad fan usually.  However, I would have wanted a bit more tomato.  And a bit more watercress.  More salad.  Please.\n\n3.  Fingerling potato home fries were all right.  Not the best.  Nothing wrong with them, but next to the Benny & Salad, they didn't measure up.  I ate most of the potatoes with sriracha ketchup (which was asked for and served separately).\n\n4.  Also tried my companion's Lancaster Omelette with goat cheese, spinach, applewood smoked bacon -- it tasted okay, but the egg seemed overcooked.  I didn't want another bite.  But, I'm not into omelettes or overcooked beaten eggs in general.\n\nGreat service.  Friendly and helpful.  When asked, our server gave a detailed description of the Benedict, which definitely informed my decision -- the watercress salad isn't mentioned on the menu, and he told me about it.  I don't know if the Benny's always served with the watercress salad, so I'll have to ask when I'm back.\n\nWashrooms feel cramped and grungy -- more like a bar than a nice brunch place.

It's tucked between the rowdiness and nostalgic kitsch of New Deck Tavern (an Irish bar) and the schizophrenia of Saturn Hair Club, purveyor of hairdos, lattes, and Vietnamese sandwiches (all quite decent, I've heard). Nothing says \"it's so good to catch up with you buddy ol' pal\" or \"yes - this is a date\" better than dinner in the main dining rooms of White Dog. The d\u00e9cor is a lesson in hominess: the wainscoting and beige walls, the photo frames paying homage to an extended canine family, and the dainty lamps whose shades emit the cozy yellow hue of dinnertime. Its warmness and intimacy is rare for a restaurant. It's easy to lose yourself in conversation, your thoughtfully prepared dishes, or a pitcher of Yuengling and forget that you're not in your dining room, or any other person's dining room for that much (it only takes a glance up at the dog portraits hanging everywhere to set off an eerie, Planet of the Apes alarm in one's head that humans have been supplanted in the course of earthly civilization.)\n\nFood at White Dog Cafe is tasty and elegant, without being fussy. I'm a fan of the chicken (excusez-moi, \"locally raised free-range hen\") and fish dishes. Whether roasted or seared or other, the method of preparation is usually just right, and the main show is usually complemented by fresh vegetables and fairly subtle sauces. It's hard to say whether free range this and organic that really make a difference other than tacking several dollars to the bill. However, many yuppies will be comforted to know that the dollars they jettison into the sustainable food ether via White Dog get recombobulated by cosmic forces (I hear Adam Smith's invisible hand pitches in sometimes), packed into sandbags, and distributed to third world farmers for use as animal feed, mulch, or an effective caulking agent when mixed with water.* \n\nThe hungry diner is warned: upon leaving White Dog Cafe, you will probably feel compelled to drop by New Deck next door for an order of Awesome Cheese Fries. The portions at White Dog are not so small as to cause indignation, or French restaurant-esque cognitive dissonance (my two shrimp and sprig of parsley - they were out of this world man! The sauce, the sauce!), but the typical White Dog meal will land you somewhere just north of \"not-hungry\" and several steps short of \"sated.\" This said, it'd be most wise to have the Dark Chocolate Chipotle Pot De Cr\u00e8me after your meal - still one of the best desserts I've had anywhere.\n\nThen there's the bar at White Dog Cafe - good for college students who can barely afford a $10 dinner but also a great place for you and your fellow chaps to knock back a few. The bar menu offers tasty bites - chief among them, the grass-fed beef burger (as a Californian, I vow it's better than In-n-Out) and the nachos with salsa, guacamole, beans, and cheese melted over - each under or around the $10 mark. The bar also offers a great selection of Pennsylvania beers and ales on draught and changes seasonally. By the power vested in me as a long time patron, though, I declare there is nothing sweeter in life than a pitcher of Yuengling and the nachos.

It was such a kind gesture and the service was so happy and genuine--basically the perfect way to start out our meal.\n\nThe bread that came out was warm, slightly crispy on the outside, and wonderfully soft on the inside.\n\nSalmon carpaccio: this was the special appetizer for the night, and it was well worth it.  The salmon was fresh and flavorful, and it was accented lightly with lemon juice.  The plate was garnished with a potato chip with craime fraiche on top and caviar.  A great, fresh starter that I highly recommend if it is available.\n\nLamb bolognese: This dish is so hearty and delicious.  The pasta is cooked perfectly and the lamb and sauce are so flavorful with just the perfect kick to it.  I really cannot eat spicy food, and this was completely tolerable for me.\n\nCheese grits: I have never had grits before, but I am obsessed with this stuff.  It is so creamy, rich, and cheesy with a little pepper kick, and this little bowl will really fill you up.  So if you have room, I suggest you try this!  Even if you don't, order it to go and heat it up the next day because it will still be delicious.\n\nLobster mac and cheese: Just as delicious as I remember.  This time we got HUGE CHUNKS of lobster, which made it even better!  I will ALWAYS get the lobster mac and cheese at White Dog because it is so irresistible.\n\nOverall, a completely decadent, flavorful, filling, and wonderful meal.  We could barely finish half of it because everything we got was so creamy, but the leftovers were just as delicious the next day!  White Dog has now earned itself the status of my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia for a nice dinner, and I recommend it to all of my friends who want to take out significant others/friends for a delicious, classy meal.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:58:37Z","yelp_user_id":"QwXpGYoZ4eUE4Bp_sQWj2Q"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:08:06Z","date":"2011-01-13","review_id":"DCDHlW-2ICacEYI_3N0jkw","stars":5,"text":"Freaking amazing. \n\nIf you're vegan, or even if you're not, get the Grilled Kennett Square Portobello & Spicy Cress Sandwich.

Nonetheless, the White Dog bar (separate from restaurant) is probably one of my favorite places at Penn. The solid feel of the counter, the various barkeeps' music in the background, and the relatively inexpensive bar fare keeps bringing me back (here: good conversations with friends = given).\n\nThe bar menu at White Dog is solid--offering your typical bar food along with the one of the best tasting chicken sandwiches I've ever had in my life.* The succulent chicken sandwich is delicious, but the Cajun string beans that come on the side are even more savory. Fried to a perfect crispy texture and jumbled in a salty-spicy sauce, the string beans are possibly actually the best thing not on the menu. I have ordered the string beans alone...perhaps a better bar food than fries...mildly healthier at least.\n\nAside from that, the happy hour at White Dog is quite good. From Sunday thru Thursday (10 PM - midnight), pints are $2...and this isn't your plebian macro-brew. Instead, you get a fine pint from a local micro-brewery. My favorite is the Troeg's Nut Brown Ale. It tastes like chocolate.\n\nLastly, you can feel good about eating here because part of White Dog's mission includes serving the community and the Earth. Thus, all the food comes from organic local farms and most of the adult beverages come from local sources when possible.\n\n*good vegetarian options also available\n\nP.S. A little about the restaurant...White Dog has an Americana cuisine. It's pretty tasty and always fresh. A bit pricey and could be more innovative on the restaurant menu.\n\nP.P.S.

When my meal alone comes to almost $50 without drinks I expect perfection and it just wasn't there.  The waitress was very well trained (serving the ladies first, clearing only after everyone was done eating, etc), but the food was average and the dining room was quite loud.  When we sat down one of us ended up with a lunch menu, the problem was quickly fixed, but we all noticed, as expected, that the prices were much more reasonable.  Next time we're doing lunch.\n\nThe Spicy Lamb Bolognese wasn't spicy, rather the meat was dry and the sauce tasted like a typical vodka sauce.  It was very good and was a rather large portion for such an expensive restaurant; I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe Duet of Duck was wonderfully prepared, but I'm sure they didn't have to give you so little.  I swear the entire plate could have been eaten in one bite if adequate motivation challenged were applied to the situation.  The homemade mustard was great, but next time put your effort into serving enough to share the dish with a loved one.\n\nLast, the fried green tomatoes were too hard for my liking, green doesn't necessarily mean not yet ripe, but I'm sure this was just someone else's take on the dish.  My only argument would be that the texture of the tomato distracted me from the over flavor.  We didn't finish the tomatoes.\n\nTo end on a good note, the menu states 18% gratuity is added to parties of 5 or more, it wasn't added to our party of 7.  I'm positive the waitress benefited from this as we are all in the habit of tipping 20%.  Also, the waitress was willing to split the bill between seven people and four credit cards.

After I noticed the pace, I timed it at 20 minutes between when he cleared our dishes off and asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu. 20 minutes! It think our entrees sat for a while before being served to us as well because he forgot about us, but that's just a hunch.\n\nI got the rib-eye special, which was totally overcooked and kind of hard - definitely not juicy like i'd expect a fresh, local steak to be. It was served with some sort of fried scallion/onion which were hard and stale, really not good. The greens were whatever too. Overall a solid 2 star dish.\n\nHowever, everything else got rave reviews. I tried my friend's duck, which was very good. Our appetizers were great (apple cider pumpkin soup was my choice and I was happy). I didn't try the flounder but my friends enjoyed it. Our desserts (dark chocolate pot, bread pudding) were very solid as well.\n\nOverall, I think I would enjoy coming back here and I probably will.

I usually dislike places that push the whole sustainable food thing, but this place does it without being too preachy - or at least they've not been too preachy to me.\n\nThe bathroom signs can be confusing. I don't know what the sex difference, if any, between a pointer and a setter.

As a fan of local growing, slow food, and organic ingredients, I insisted on going there on a trip to Philly from DC. The experience was good+, just shy of great.\n\nACCESS\nThere's street and garage parking nearby, but as this is in the heart of UPenn, Drexel, and Children's Hospital, be prepared to pay.\n\nLOCATION / DECOR\nThe decor is wonderful, ranging from the full-bloom flower boxes (in May) to the hand-painted lintels on the roof held up by (faux) wrought-iron finnels. Large, cozy bar inside. Many separate seating areas and private rooms on two floors add an eclectic mood to the place (and it's obviously 1 or 2 old converted brownstones, so the funky architecture adds to the experience). A lot of warm, welcoming wood and glass.\n\nOutdoor seating is in the front on a gently-used alley and separated from sidewalk traffic by more faux wrought iron fencing. Comfortable and spacious.\n\nI could do without the wall-to-wall murals of crapping dogs that are in the bathroom and look like they were painted by a team of 2nd graders.\n\nSERVICE\nThe service at the bar was great if a half-notch over the top (\"Yes, sir! No, sir! That's a local beer, sir!\"). The 'tender let me sample one of the Philly microbrews and sold me on the Yard's Brawler. He then kindly transferred our bill to our table after a seat became available...a small, but welcome convenience.\n\nThe waitress was a little harried, but competent and nice. I asked to see a dinner menu (at lunch...just to see what else they offered), but never got it; not a big deal just one of those things.\n\nFOOD\nThe food was good. My wife and I are vegetarian and knew WDC wasn't a veggie only place (responsible/organic/local, but not veggie) and so were disappointed when 1 out of 3 veggie lunch options were out. Food is on the slightly pricey side, with one of the other 3 options being a full entre plate of tofu and stir-fried veggies for $13...more than I want to pay for lunch, even for organic.\n\nVery nitpicky: My wife's veggie wrap (good) came with a side-salad of garden greens. It was passable, not inspired (3 grape tomatoes cut in half on top, no nuts/seeds, no cheese), but the dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette. Okay, I'm a snob, but you can make this stuff by the gallon and it's completely unremarkable. I would expect a restaurant like the WDC to offer a few clever spins on these old standby's: how about an atypical dressing, a cracker or bread at the start of the meal, a finisher of some kind? \n\nWhen you're good people know it, but when you're unique, people remember.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:44:35Z","yelp_user_id":"xzR18D-NbiTJLnqrbOOg-A"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:26:20Z","date":"2011-07-12","review_id":"ExSWtAoO0uKvA3HuPqenUA","stars":4,"text":"I went here for lunch, had excellent food, and everything is made from fresh and natural ingredients.

The cut was too thick, too dry, and chewy. You need an extremely sharp knife to pierce through the rubbery surface of this really tough, unmarinated slab of meat. The butter sauce had no flavor, and the (crispy) onion straws on top were mostly soggy and greasy. \n\nBrunch here is not too outrageously priced. For $14, I got the Crab and Spinach Benedict, which was good by itself, but the side salad was bitter, chewy (in a tough, hard to fit inside your mouth kind of way), and tossed in a flavorless dressing, accompanied by cold and dry fingerling potatoes.\n\nI've been to other Philly restaurants with a similar concept, but with much better-executed food. Something that stands out at White Dog is that they don't seem to get any of the sauces right. The lack of effort or skill in the way they make the food makes me feel like they are exploiting the idea of supporting local farmers to sell over-priced food to a well-intentioned community.\n\nAlso, the restrooms here make me feel glad that I'm on the petite side.

I have never eaten a tougher steak anywhere in my life.  Two of my companions also ordered the sirloin and they experienced the same thing.  It was like the steak was laced with gristle.  I had ordered mine to be cooked medium rare[it was more medium than rare] yet it was still tough to cut and chewing became an adventure in trying to wash down the last bit of gristle.  Dessert was fine, I ordered the Corn Fritters.  Service was not very good either, we had a guy[girl?] named Rath who wasn't very attentive and pretty much non-existant.  I think it took us 20 minutes to get bread after sitting down.  Overall the group of 6 of us came out disappointed.

What is IT you ask?  \n\nA HUGE cockroach the size of half my hand crawling up and down the wall above my bf's head!  HOLY CRAP I told him to get up because it was crawling towards him.  The two of us stood up away from our table and just stared at it not knowing what to do.  We called the waitress over and told her dude you have a fat ass cockroach crawling on your wall.  By then the cockroach had walked up the wall into the shelf where they stored all the glass cups.  So it was in there mingling with all your cups.  The cups are also placed upside down so I'm sure it touched all the rims.  She apologizes to us and that's it...nothing...we didn't get our dinner comp-ed...we didn't get a discount...and the kicker...\n\nNO ONE WASHED THE CUPS where the cockroach walked all over...\n\nWhat are they trying to do?

We had the trio of hummus for our appetizer (I think by now my Yelp profile establishes how much I love hummus).    It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.  We also ran out of vegetables, etc. to actually eat the hummus with, but we couldn't find our waiter to get more bread.  I ordered the veggie wrap without cheese.  Since it was $13, I expected it to be the best wrap of my life.  It was decent, but nothing special.  I don't think that a slice of cheese would have changed it that much.

I spent an academic year lusting after the delicious smells wafting out of the tastefully decorated front door, while I settled for dining hall pizza.\n\nWell, I finally ate at White Dog last September with a couple of friends in celebration of the start of a new school year. As a poor college kid, I ordered a $14 medium rare burger that I couldn't quite afford. I had reasonably high expectations for that burger, because of the wafting smell thing and fourteen dollar price tag. Also I think the menu gave a lengthy description of the burger's origin, something about grassfed cagefree vegetarian organic amish cows. \n\nWhen our food arrived, my medium rare burger turned out to be well-done. And not in the good sense of the word. In the charred gray not a hint of pink to be found anywhere how could anyone desecrate a fine piece of beef like that sense of the word. \n\nI politely pointed out the burger's well-done-ness to our waiter, who apologized profusely and hustled off the kitchen to order another. I spent the next 20-30 minutes daydreaming about my burger watching my friends eat their food thinking that our waiter must have effed up and written down the wrong order because how could anyone work at a place like White Dog NOT know how to cook a medium rare burger?\n\nBy the time my second burger arrived, my friends had finished eating. I was slightly annoyed that my bun wasn't toasted this time, because they took 20-30 minutes to remake a burger in a nearly empty restaurant and didn't have the decency to toast the bun. I was more than slightly annoyed when I cut into it and realized that this burger looked exactly like the first one. In fact, they had probably just spit on it a few times re-warmed it and slapped it on a cold bun. I didn't have time to try my luck a third time, so I just ate it. After hastily dropping of burger dos, our waiter made himself scarce until it was bill time. Didn't ask how my food was, didn't refill our water glasses, I mean the man was avoiding us! \n\nWhile we were waiting for our bill, a family at the table next to ours asked the waiter to explain to their kids what the difference was between a well-done, medium-well, medium, medium-rare, and rare burger. Before beginning his spiel he shot our table a glance to see if we were listening. We were. With rapt attention. I've never seen anyone get that red while saying the words \"a medium-rare burger should be pinky-red in the center.\" When he picked up our plates, I left nothing but a sizable chunk of grey hamburger on mine. He still made no comment. When he came back to drop off the bill, I told him that my second burger was no rarer than my first, and that he should let the cook know how his medium rare burgers were turning out. He apologized again and ran off with our money. No offer for a free burger, no nuffin. We ended up giving him a pity tip because honestly his life must just be terrible if he had too much anxiety to take ownership of an overcooked burger.\n\nSo in summary: over-hyped, over-priced, poorly executed food. Either vindictive or completely incompetent kitchen staff. Sheepish servers. I'd hit up random freshman for a guest swipe into Kings Court English House's dining hall before I go back there.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:29:35Z","yelp_user_id":"9CIenZIHU0FDIkcnqycVyA"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:33:09Z","date":"2008-03-14","review_id":"Q5u6_x3oqDh7GRZguhd-5w","stars":3,"text":"Pretty good food (better values on the bar menu, although the limited selection gets old pretty quickly) that places an emphasis on local and sustainable ingredients, which seems to be sorely lacking at many other Philadelphia restaurants.

In Philadelphia, they have White Dog. Both of them are named as dogs, bringing out friendly qualities, but they are certainly different breeds.\n\nUnlike busy NY dog offering breakfast, delivery and catering, Philly dog managed to be civilized; Late morning start, maybe taking a walk, short lunch, then afternoon (tea) break, then dinner, and Brunch only on weekends. You know, this Philly dog has a life. \n\nThey live in different houses, too. Philly dog owns a Victorian brownstone house. You pass through a narrow door, then walk through narrow corridors to find your own table. You have lots of options. Do you want a table at the sun-filled-greenhouse-feel room? Or rather dark cushion sofas? Or wooden bar with a high chair? Each choice is very British. It's easy to imagine you see Shylock Holmes with a pipe at the corner booth. Oh, when this dog wants to escape from Philadelphia city life, she (I decide this is SHE) goes to the peaceful farm house in Wayne. \n\nNY dog doesn't seem to be bothered to share one big room with everyone. You walk in the door, boom, one big shared space. No privacy or fun labyrinth. One way, straightforward, but communal. Does he (yes, this is HE) have a vacation house? Not yet. But he just purchased another city house in Chelsea. All rented. \n\nWhat do they eat? Quite different as you can see.\n\nPhilly dog eats only local organically grown stuff. She's been doing that so many years now, it's not even mentioned during conversations with other dogs. 95% of ingredients comes from 50 miles within. This sophisticated dog doesn't like stuff loaded in trucks or being shipped from overseas. Fair traded coffee, humanely treated animals, of course. \n\nLook at this soup, white beans and kale. White dog prepared this because it's a kale season these days. Simply steamed, salted kale with not-so-salty ham was laid on the plate when served. Then this human waiter (hired by the dog) poured white bean soup in. Result? Crunchy kale bites mingling with soup. White beans didn't have much taste, mainly because of strong ham flavor, I suspect. \n\nWhy I ordered this orange ginger tofu? I don't know. Any Chinese place will do a better job. Fried tofu had thick batter. It made a chef to cook easily, but landed on my tongue toughly. Mandarin, bell peppers, broccoli, nuts, peas, carrots, cabbages, rice were fresh, though. Just not distinctive enough. Then again, this dog is all about freshness. \n\nWhile I was cleaning out the dishes, people were coming in. Soon this room was filled with voices; Wikileaks this, Wikileaks that, 21st century marketing strategy, someone's tenure track... You can tell this is a hangout scene for University of Pennsylvania faculties. Of course, UPenn students made scenes, too. This is a place to treat your date after gruesome final exams. However, decision between having one crab cake dish or having 4 chinese take outs could be tough.\n\nI like Grey dog in NY, too. The point is that only being White or Grey could be boring. You need Grey dog for late night catch up with buddies, or when you crave salty stuffing salads. And when you need a space for reflection without anybody bothering you, or just want to pretend you're a faculty member at UPenn, you need White dog.\n\nOr maybe White and Grey dogs need to marry...? White has a nice house, money, sophistication, social responsibility supporting local farmers and Grey knows how to work diligently day and night.\n\nBeauty and the Beast? Yeah..They will make a good couple, I can see that.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:08:04Z","yelp_user_id":"9Ukyv7dAde0H7oAU0NgsFg"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:25:53Z","date":"2011-06-24","review_id":"rUjkCphgPs4v5ngeDbkajQ","stars":2,"text":"After White Dog changed owners, I felt the food quality had stayed the same, and that the presentation had improved.

It's set in and accurately depicts what is perhaps the darkest period of Philly's history, the 1970s, when Philly was a down-and-out former industrial power suffering along-with-but-possibly-more-than-most American cities through the social and economic \"malaise\" of the day.\n\nBut right in the middle of those dark days, there were rays of light cast on our once-and-future fair city by the restaurateurs who were the vanguard of what would be called Philadelphia's \"Restaurant Renaissance\".  Those brave visionaries most notably included George Perrier (Le Bec Fin), Reed Apaghian (Astral Plane), and Judy Wicks, the owner to this day of the venerable White Dog Cafe.\n\nWith an eclectic menu, quirky sense of self deprecating but unapologetically liberal humor, comfortable atmosphere, attentive professional service, and a dedication to locally grown food, The White Dog remains to this day the standard against which all similarly missioned establishments must be compared.  True, it is no longer unique or edgy, but that is more a testament to its success than evidence of any failure.\n\nYes, it is quite expensive, so it is the kind of place where we go for dinner only occasionally, and then almost always for special events in a larger group.  But the portions remain quite ample, and I have certainly shelled out similar levels of cash for far less generously filled plates.  And the food never, ever disappoints.\n\nA great way to experience The White Dog (at least for two people) is to eat at the bar.  You may have to wait a while for hard-to-come-by seats, and you won't have access to the full menu, but the bar food menu is a treat in its own right.\n\nSo do yourselves a favor and make sure you experience The White Dog at least once.

I ordered their burger and a Victory Pilsner. The bartender gave a fast pour of the Victory. I sat down at a small table to the side, since the bar was full. The Pilsner tasted funky, like someone hadn't cleaned out the lines in a while. Maybe I should make a list of all the bars who never clean their lines out. That might be a tall order around here though.\n\nMy burger came out after a medium wait. The fries were crisp, some a little too crisp like they'd been sitting in the frier a little too long. The burger itself was cooked ok on the outside and the cheese was melted in. Unfortunately they undercooked it again. Medium does not mean medium rare. If I see much more than a little pink, that's NOT medium. I ended up eating the burger because I was starving. Bad decision. In the middle of the night I woke up and had some problems. I even felt bad the next day until after 6pm. If Clint Eastwood was shooting this, he would have called it  \"White Dog, Black Commode\". \n\nSecond time, shame on me.

This means that the White Dog gets to charge as much as they want for their food and drink--there's simply no competition.\n\nThe tap list is generally excellent, and pints tend to be $5 apiece.  We had drinks in the piano bar recently, which is a really comfortable, dimly lit space, and we had a great time.  This is one place we come when there's a special occasion and we can't think of anywhere else to go.\n\nThe food is where the White Dog really gouges you.  Tofu and vegetables for $13?  And that's just the lunch menu.  In general, the food has been pretty good, if overpriced, and if we or someone we know is feeling a little fancy we'll come here.  They took the \"Chihuahua\" egg dish off the brunch menu, although it was excellent.  But it's always with a tinge of regret that I eat here.  Local and organic are honorable commitments.  Totally screwing your customers with your pricing because they have no place else to go is another thing.  But I guess that's the free market.

I went to Drexel, had friends at Penn and still currently live in West Philly, so I have been here a number of times.  Dinner can be pricey, but they have a kind of bar and grill with lower-priced items.  A nice place to sit outside with a pitcher of beer and a burger on a warm summer night.\n\nThe decor is very home-y and kind of country and of course dog-themed.  It sounds kind of cheesy, but it's very whimsical and kind of tongue-in-cheek at times (one set of bathrooms are labeled Pointers and Setters!

I also really like the ethos of the restaurant and I'm happy to pay a little more to support local restaurants as charming as this one.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:19:48Z","yelp_user_id":"q3APTwLmgeDAMz2lXlqK3g"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T18:19:15Z","date":"2010-09-03","review_id":"z7c-_fFg3qsLrQy2YYx-kQ","stars":2,"text":"I had the lunch special.

They also refused to supplement our \"main dining room menu\"  with the \"bar menu\" (read: cheaper, more student-friendly, and more variegated)  which was slightly infuriating because we would have ordered from both the regular menu AND the bar menu!!! As it was, the group ended up not even wanting to order that much food off the main menu because it was just so damn pricey, and there wasn't much variety to choose from.\n  We got crammed into this tiny and dimly lit (but kinda cute, I guess-- stars on the ceiling and a \"sun\" ceiling light) area with a group of 4 older patrons.\nOur waitress Kelly seemed nice enough, but kind of fawned over the group of old people much more than our group of 8. We ended up not getting even a bread basket until almost 30 minutes into the dinner, and that's only because I put on a sour face and asked 2 different servers for it THRICE. Meanwhile, the old people sharing our room kept staring at our empty dining table and wondered aloud if they should give us their extra bread basket (but never made a move).\nOverall, not a great dining experience and the food wasn't THAT good. The lobster mac n' cheese appetizer literally comes in a tiny asian-style rice bowl, and while the 'mac' part was actually quite good (I think they use shells shaped pasta?), the ONE lobster chunk i found in the bowl tasted kind of awful. Too bad for a fairly expensive appetizer. Also got the scallop appetizer, which also wasn't too great, owing to the weirdly sweet and pasty sauce it came in.\nOur group got several entrees, the only memorable one (and incidentally, the cheapest) was the lamb bolognese. None of the other fish/pork dishes ordered by my group were outstanding, and CERTAINLY not worth the $20+ price tags.  Save yourself money and time, and go for some less claustrophobic restaurant with better, more inspiring food.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:07:33Z","yelp_user_id":"_dujFb2ACPsvP4qKXkgPHQ"},{"business_id":"ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA","created_at":"2013-03-15T15:31:38Z","date":"2011-08-27","review_id":"zyXLo4_4Ye-0QWM3LDrQkw","stars":3,"text":"Really more like 3.5 stars...\n\nI've been here twice for lunch and have been impressed with the food both times.

I will say that the sandwich was perfectly toasted and tasted really, really good- in fact it is probably one of the best veggie sandwiches I've had in a restaurant, but it is just too pricey. The mushroom soup is also excellent- definitely more mushroom flavor than cream which I appreciated. The decor is cozy, but the service is surprisingly standard.

It wasn't the type of harder stringy noodle that I liked more. We also ordered the agedashi tofu and gyoza. The adegashi tofu was piping hot, pretty sure I burnt my tongue. I don't know whether they were trying to compensate for the hotness, but the gyoza was kind of cold. Taste for both appetizers wasn't flavorful enough for me. Other people in my party had the tonkatsu chashumen and shoyu.They thought it was okay for Philly. My friend's chasu still had strings on there. The did apologize and gave us a discount. I was kind of surprised that you had to pay extra $1 to add an egg to the noodle. \n\nThis place is alright. It's at an excellent location.

But fortunately we were first in line and it only took 10mins to seat us. And so, my buddy runs to his car and brings in our case of beer as they are still pending liquor license.\n\n2 more of our friends show up and luck would have it with us, the table to the right finishes up and we politely ask the waiter if we can combine that table with us. She agreed and all 7 of us sat comfortably. \n\nI'm a Ramen snob and from what I read here, people always brings up Ippudo ( - 5/5 for them) as if that's the benchmark? What a bunch of newbs, but let me move on. I've lived in Japan, tried ramen in thailand, germany and all across of the US. I'll break down the food for you first.\n\nI ordered two bowls of Ramen. The Tonkotsu Ramen, and the Kara Kara Ramen. By the time I finished my first beer, our food came. Can't say how long that was as I was with good company and not thinking about time.\n\nTonkotsu Ramen:\nBroth -  My first impression was wow, it's quite flavorful with good texture. A few more sips, I concluded that it had a little too much salt for favoring. I think if they reduce the salt, the broth is splendid.\nNoodle - They used a thin style noodle which to me is unorthodox Ramen style noodle. It was cooked for a little too long and came out too soft, tasted a little buttery? Like I had powder left over in my mouth. The noodles was the weakest point, but then I found out that you can get the thicker more traditional noodles, of which I will do next time.\nChashu - I bite into it and it was good. I liked it. No complaints really. Only suggestion is cook it just like longer to make it more tender. I just felt a little more resistance than I wanted, but not enough to make me think twice. \nOverall - 4/5 (my rating is as follows: Broth hold the most weight, then noodle, then toppings)\n\nKaraKaraRamen:\nBroth - My feelings are conflicted here. I want to like it, but something is nagging me. After going through the bowl, I realize what it is. CONFLICT. It's trying to be Tonkotsu flavored and Spicy flavored at the same time, but the flavors do not compliment each other, rather it is like a tug of war. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.\nNoodle - same noodle, see my comments above.\nChashu - see my comments above.\nOverall - 3/5 - Personally from my experience, I think in order to make a spicy style ramen work, you must start with a softer texture base and the tonkotsu base here was a little too heavy, which resulted in the conflict.\n\nMy sister ordered the Takoyaki, of which I really liked a lot! Yummy! =) \n\nDecor (5/5): If you know Ramen, you know ramen is a poor man's food. In the old days, you hand wooden stands and stools and a wooden counter you ate at with complete view of the chef making your ramen. I thought Ramen Bar did really well in this area.\n\n- Open kitchen. We can see exactly how our food is being prepared and who's doing what. This gives me a comfort of mind to know that my food is not being...messed with! Plus, it follows tradition.\n- All wood. This was a BIG PLUS for me. All wood is huge, and it's a light tone, with good lighting. It follows that nature scheme without being pretentiousness.\n- Bar and stool front facing seating. This is a must have for me at any ramen bar. This caters to the traveler eaters that eats alone. And I travel for a living, so when I see seating like this, I love it. I don't feel so...lonely when I'm trying out Ramen.\n\nOverall - Ramen Bar comes off as a modern take with simplistic design principles that really brings out the Japanese culture. I like it a lot.\n\nService (4/5) - To put it simply, the service is Reactive, rather than Proactive. Whenever we needed something, a waiter was within reach. But they are not proactive in the sense that they will keep checking up on you to see if everything is okay. This is fine with me as I'm used to asian restaurants. Take a look at the restaurants in chinatown, service is freaking horrible, but do you hear people complaining? They don't because they have grown used to it. I have no qualms with calling a waiter over when I need something. But yes, I think service can improve, but I know they are just student waiters so I'm giving them some slack. \n\nOverall - I see potential in Ramen Bar. I believe it can be something great as long as it continues to ask for feedback and improve on it. It may be a 3/5 overall, but I'm going to give it a 4/5 for the fact that I have tried Ramen Boy, Yakitori and Nom Nom and from an overall delivery, from design, cleanliness, service and food, they are the best in Philly and offers the most room for improvements. Oh, and a great location to boot with easy parking for me. I hate finding parking in chinatown or rittenhouse square. I have yet to try Terakawa.

It was just 2 hours into its grand opening, but it had already managed to run out of most of its appetizers - disappointing. The only promising appetizer was the edamame, which is a very hard dish to mess up. But lo and behold, Ramen Bar managed to completely ruin it for me. When it arrived, it smelled funny. Then I took a bite.. it was revolting. It hit me that it smelled and tasted like dirty socks. I've had edamame at countless restaurants over the years, but never had a single place managed to make it with the stench of dirty socks. We immediately asked for it to be taken back. How can you eat something that's so absolutely disgusting? I completely lost my appetite, and believe the restaurant must have some hygiene issues. I've been to hole-in-the-wall, sketchy looking restaurants and ordered edamame, but never had a place ruined the simplest dish you can have.\n\nI had also ordered their featured ramen, which was very bland and not cooked well. The noodles were hard and did not absorb any flavor from the broth, and the toppings did not taste fresh nor complemented the ramen well at all. It was edible, and I would rate it a generous 2 out of 5 stars.\n\nOverall, I had high expectations for this new restaurant but was severely disappointed and felt sick for the rest of the night after the meal. It tries to completely copy the restaurant concepts (and menus) of Ippudo and Momofuku, but failed miserably.

This was our second attempt at eating here; the first attempt we were turned away because the restaurant had ran out of food.  There's no doubt that it's a gorgeous space that is open and airy, and the ramen is actually pretty good.  However our appetizer was uninspired, the food is overpriced, and the service needs a bit of fine tuning.\n\nThe BF and I started with the Takoyaki, something I imagine Guy Fieri would create if he was given the opportunity to make Japanese food.  Deep fried octopus cakes in a way too sweet barbecue sauce (reminiscent of what one might eat with McDonald's chicken nuggets, as the BF noted) with flimsy, salty bonito flakes and some other tan colored sauce (Spicy mayo maybe?).  It  wasn't very good to say the least.  For dinner, I ordered the Kara Kara Tonkutso Ramen.  Described as a spicy ramen, I was disappointed that the broth wasn't spicer.  Only after adding red pepper and sesame oil did I get the right heat.  Aside from that, the rest of the soup was very good.  The pork was tender and juicy, the noodles chewy and soft (maybe could have been a little thinner), and the hard boiled egg was pure perfection.\n\nBut while I found the ramen to be pretty good, it was the little details that kept throwing me off.  Our server was clearly new: even though we had ordered appetizers she asked us if we wanted to order them; when she came to check on us, she asked us if we had a problem with the food; and when I took a break midway through my meal, she asked if I was done with dinner.  I also found the spoons served with the ramen to be cute, but impractical.\n\nHowever, my biggest complaint is the price.  It's really too expensive.  I've accepted paying $10 or more for a bowl of ramen, but I don't understand why some of the standard components of the dish (including the egg, pork, and fish cake) are not included in the dish.  It felt wrong to have to order those items separately, and to be honest, every other ramen joint I've been to includes those types of items in the dish.  It just seems unfair.  I don't know if it's an issue of rent, the quality of ingredients (it's not, as evidenced by witnessing the chef loading in frozen pre-made shrimp shumai from a bag into the kitchen), or the way thing are done here, but it's just not right in my opinion.\n\nOverall, the decor and atmosphere is beautiful and the ramen is good, but high prices, poor service, and otherwise uninspiring food will probably not make this one of our regular hangouts.

But lacking in something that made me want to finish my meal. \nYesterday I went back with a group and I got the vegetable miso ramen and the taste was 4 stars for this.. but it may have been affected by the following...(we were starving by the time we got our food)\n\nService/Wait time - 1 to 2 stars at most\n- My bf and I waited for 40 minutes for our food. Come on enow\n- Yesterday, a group of 14 of us arrived after making reservations on Thursday night. We arrived and they said they \" lost our reservation\". Really? Good job guys. So we had to wait. They did seat us and were friendly, but this is where there service is inexperienced. They are NICE, but new.. absolutely new. 6 of us had napkins/chopsticks, the others did not. Another server came over to hand us menus because she noticed we didn't have any. \nAfter ordering, we waited... ONE HOUR. Yes i said it, ONE FULL HOUR to receive all our food. And they were completely inconsistent. My friend sitting next to me received her food 30 minutes before the last of our group received theirs. I do commend the sever for getting my order correctly because I specifically asked for no pickled onions or fungus and they were not in my order, Thank you. That's why this is a 2 star not 1 star review.\n\nOverall summary? The fried chicken appetizer is dry - don't get it. The ramen is pretty good, honestly quite good. But I would NOT go back for maybe another 6 months to see if their service has improved. The food is good. But the service is completely inexperienced. NICE, but inexperienced. ONE HOUR WAIT + losing reservations + half of us not having utensils + (i forgot to mention they moved us again after we were seated ..)  = they need more time to improve. They have promise, but for now.. I will wait for them to change certain things. If I wasn't with a group, I would have left after 20 minutes.\n\nTip : they are CASH ONLY right now. Which is a big pet peeve of mine. I know asian restaurants love this shit, but come on its 2012. There are commercials about square card readers. Homeless people can get that stuff. Plus, I know that certain companies only take 2-3% of the profit.. I don't respect businesses as much that value their profit over convenience of their customers. But that's just my personal opinion.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:53:19Z","yelp_user_id":"hQjN1FuYaB4pQACZwfrclw"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:03:59Z","date":"2012-10-13","review_id":"RYeXhjSsNK81iFI8teRzNA","stars":4,"text":"Not bad ramen.

And they have VEGAN RAMEN with VEGAN BROTH?! I'm sold!\n\nSince I've been a vegetarian my entire life, I've always been envious of all my friends who get to slurp down ramen. It's been one of my biggest foodie dreams to finally have a bowl of ramen someday, and Ramen Bar has provided me with that.\n\nMy 4 friends and I decided to go to Ramen Bar on a Thursday night around 7:30pm. It was packed! Fortunately, though, we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated at the clean, wooden tables. A notable feature abour Ramen Bar is the open kitchen you pass by, where you can see everything the chefs are doing. You can see that they're actually making everything from scratch, in a very clean setting, so that's reassuring.\n\nSince the restaurant is so new, the waitstaff are a bit flustered, but they're extremely friendly and willing to do anything to accomodate the guests. When we were ordering, my friend and I both ordered veggie ramen, and she made sure to ask if we wanted the vegetarian broth (with traces of pork...) or have freshly made vegan broth at no additional charge. Awesome! She also gave our table great recommendations on toppings, and our water was filled fairly regularly.\n\nIt took about 20 minutes for our ramen to come out, which was impressive for how crowded the restaurant was. I ordered a Veggie Shoyu Ramen with curly noodles and was extremely impressed by the beautiful presentation and aroma of the dish. The taste was even better! Obviously, I am no ramen snob, and have nothing to compare this ramen to, but aaaahhh finally having veg ramen for the first time in my life!!! To me, the dish was excellent! The addition of sriracha just made it better. All of my friends were really impressed as well, and we had quite a jovial time. I tried my friend's Veggie Miso Ramen with straight noodles, and it was amazing too.\n\nThe only downside was that my friend ordered a 2nd order of noodles ($2,) but they didn't come in time, since they're prepared from scratch. However, the kind waitress packed it to-go for him, as well as gave him more complimentary broth, which was appreciated. Also, $8 to $12 for a bowl of ramen is steep, but not steep enough to keep me away from coming back every time my wallet can afford it!\n\nMoral of the story: I'm not sure how good this ramen is for omnivorous ramen snobs, but if you're a vegetarian/vegan dying to finally try ramen, this is the place!","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:52:48Z","yelp_user_id":"Le9KD2nTc1VR8vGykR6qLg"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:49:19Z","date":"2012-09-24","review_id":"TM6ny-dfJeI0nOmILlCY5w","stars":4,"text":"Alright,\n\nJust so you don't think I'm trying to be flaky here, I'm increasing my review one more time. We recently came back for another try. I was worried it was too early, but the option of a hot bowl of ramen on a cold afternoon was just too enticing to turn down.\n\nWe came back again, and boy were we happy we did this time!\n\nThe RB burger appetizer was GREAT! The bun was light, soft, slightly sweet, just how I like it - and the pork was juicy and soft - the way it should be - and as if the sauce inside the bun wasn't already good enough, there was a wasabi sauce on the plate that added another level of complexity and surprise for the dish. 5/5. MUST TRY.\n\nThe tori kara-age (fried chicken appetizer) - well, it was okay. It didn't help that we got this after the RB burger. Actually, this came out even after our ramen came out. That was interesting. Anyway, the breading was thin, which I did like, but the flavoring/sauce - well, it had a bit of spicy/sweetness, and it just didn't really do it for me. 2.5/5\n\nWe got the shoyu ramen and shoyu chashumen. Looking at each bowl side by side, it was hard to tell exactly which one was which, but the soup broth was distinctly different. Again, the shoyu ramen was cleaner tasting, and surprisingly oilier than I remember. The ramen noodles were perfectly prepared this time - not too hard, not too soft, just chewy and right. My wife and I agreed that the shoyu ramen was the favorite between the 2, and I'd say that I'd rate the shoyu ramen a 5/5 (again), and the shoyu chashumen a close 4.5/5 - simply because I like the broth of the shoyu ramen more.  But hey, if you like miso, then you might appreciate the chashumen more.\n\nNext time, I'll try the Tonkotsu Ramen - that is, if I can resist the urge to get the shoyu ramen.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:09:16Z","yelp_user_id":"jqTa-RtGU26q3TFTmMZOAw"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:18:59Z","date":"2012-10-04","review_id":"UnPJ_VozKkZdAWx_et71Pw","stars":2,"text":"Most of the negativeness of this review comes from the fact that it took FOREVER to get our food. It was so bad that they started offering us free drinks and gave us our appetizer for free. We were confused because we didn't order anything weird, just ramen and octopus balls. The octopus balls came out a good minute after our ramen finally came, which was weird and they asked us if we still wanted it as if they hadn't actually put the order in...This was mostly bad because one of the people in our party came STARVING and it made for a very unhappy table. \n\nThe ramen itself was tasty though. I got the spicy one which was definitely the best of the ones at the table (one of my friends got tonkatsu, the other got the vegetarian one). It wasn't served as hot as I would have liked, but it was good until you got to the bottom and then it was crazy salty.\n\nI would like to give this place another try. Like I said, the spicy ramen was really good and the place looks nice inside, but it was kind of hard to separate it from the whole experience.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:40:00Z","yelp_user_id":"Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:45:26Z","date":"2012-09-27","review_id":"VxlBdaZHP5AzvHjptNel8w","stars":3,"text":"I think I need to go back to try the bar...\n\nBeen wanting to stop by ever since it opened on campus, but haven't really had the chance to until last week. Came for a late lunch on Sunday and we luckily avoided the wait time everyone has been complaining about. Upon entering, I loved the high ceiling and overall interior of the restaurant. It's very light wood-heavy and the lighting created a nice, chic, modern ambiance. We were quickly seated and decided to place our order.\n\nI love asking for opinions of the servers but was unfortunately disappointed when our served didn't know anything about the menu. She told us what was popular, but couldn't really tell us the differences between the many types of ramen on the menu, which I think is kinda a requirement at a ramen restaurant. We decided to go with Tonkotsu Ramen and Tonkotsu Chashumen with an egg. The only difference between them is the number of slices of pork you get (1 v. 3).\n\nThe ramen came out about 10 minutes later and I will say the presentation was great. Traditionally with ramen, you have all the ingredients layed out on top of the noodles and it was a great display. I also like tasting the broth before going right to the noodles. The broth however was very salty, with a nice, thick layer of oil on top of it. They went great with the noodles I devoured afterwards, but I refused to finish the soup at the end. I also ordered an extra order of noodles ($2 if you're feeling extra hungry) which topped off the meal.\n\nI think Ramen Bar is a step in the right direction, diversifying dining options in West Philly. However, I think it still has some things to fix before it becomes a neighborhood staple of mine. It's also very pricey (~$18 for lunch). I'm hoping their bar opens up soon; it could be a nice place to hang out with friends on chill weeknights.\n\nPros: different for the area, great interior, great noodles consistency\nCons: pricey, salty/oily broth, inexperienced wait staff","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:57:26Z","yelp_user_id":"MpRMV1IlT8jzfLdI0fGr1w"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:24:18Z","date":"2012-09-13","review_id":"wgoZN9XyhTQ7Q2J7_JN73g","stars":4,"text":"So Ramen Bar just opened 2 days ago but I predict that once word spreads, Penn undergrads will swamp this place 24/7. So visit soon, while the wait is still on the magnitude of 10's of minutes. \n\nThe decor here is pretty classy, as are the serving dishes and such: octagonal vermilion chopsticks, fancy Japanese stoneware noodle bowls. Even the spoon (or rather, wooden ladle) that comes with the ramen is like something straight out of the Edo period, though it makes it a bit difficult to get at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nAnyway, about the food. The fried octopus balls are pretty good, though they could do with more octopus and less fried coating. The flavors are nice though. We tried the tonkotsu and shoyu ramens. The tonkotsu was a light yet flavorful milky-colored broth with thinner, smoother, white ramen noodles. The shoyu is a brown broth that is slightly saltier and packs a rich umami punch. The noodles are the thicker, chewier-type yellow ramen, which I think gives it a slight edge over the tonkotsu. The pork is tasty, but the regular $10 bowl only gives you one piece. I'd go with the $12 bowl (charshumen), which gives you 3. I might skip the marinated boiled egg next time, it wasn't that marinated and didn't come whole with a nice runny yolk inside.\n\nIt seems that their bar and credit card machines aren't up and running yet, and neither are a few of the menu items. No matter, I'm sure they'll work it out in time. On a side note, it's funny and kind of cute that they make their servers greet you Japanese-style with a \"irashaimasse!\" Overall, this is some tasty ramen served in a pleasant and convenient space, so the slightly higher prices are kinda worth it.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:31:05Z","yelp_user_id":"DJp-RvWsIyX9z-8SN2N7Ag"},{"business_id":"ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:08:52Z","date":"2012-09-17","review_id":"wZ9aFkTSlxdyOkXbZBjiCA","stars":3,"text":"Kind of an awkward service experience but I think it's OK since they just opened.

As for the food, it's really good! I liked the takoyaki and the kare kare tonkatsu ramen (with all the topping suggestions).

And it took them a while to correct the missing order issue.\n\nIf this is what ethiopian food is supposed to taste like, then I guess its just not for me. The bread is made from fermented dough which increases its nutritional value but makes it taste gross. It is served cold which basically results in what tastes like a mouthful of stale sour pancake. \n\nMost of the plates had the same components and have the main item different. You can choose between beef chicken and something else.  I ordered the unmemorable something else, which was a mushy meat thingy which did not taste good. If I had to describe the taste I would say that a mentally challenged person tried to cook Indian food but used the wrong spices and left the dish out to go bad.

It was AMAZING and I instantly fell in love with Ethiopian food.  I had the vegetarian combo; I always get the same thing likely because I'm meatless.  The veggie combo is nice because you get the opportunity to try most of the veggie options offered at Shagga.  Everything is delicious!  The mesir wot (wat) is my favorite Ethiopian cuisine.  The richness of the spices dancing on my tongue with just the right amount of heat (Yumminess).   The tomato salad is light and very refreshing, the potato wot is the best I've ever had.  The lentil sambusas are excellent.   In all reality I've been to many different Ethiopian restaurants, now one of my favorite cuisines and none have been able to top Shagga.  I try to give others a try because I no longer live as close to Shagga but the rest just don't compare.  Yes, it's WWAAAAYYYYY better than Dukem.  \nThe owners are very nice humble people and always accommodating to make your visit enjoyable. Bogi, the waitress is also great, very friendly and has a warm smile.  Be sure to leave her a nice tip.  \nThe prices are very reasonable at this restaurant.  If you've never had Ethiopian food and want to try it out, go to Shagga.  I consider it a hidden gem because it's not located on U Street in DC or Downtown Silver Spring.   The veggie combo is enough food for two people so I typical have leftovers.  Don't let the portion sizes fool you.  The use of the delicate spongy injera will leave you with little to no room for dessert.   The restaurant interior is very laid back with sheer white curtains, several caf\u00e9 tables and traditional Ethiopian paintings decorating the wall.  The architecture of the building appears to be a former donut establishment.  With all of these details that may be lacking for some customers, the food makes up for it.  I have no reason to take away any stars.\nVenture out and try something you've never had before like Ethiopian food.  If your first experience was disappointing at another location, give Shagga a try.  \n\nPS: I had to make this my first review because well, I just love the food that much.

Fine, it's not as pretty inside as Dukem's, but really, they've done a very decent job with what used to be a donut shop (if I remember correctly).  \n\nThe food... the portions are generous, the dishes are uniformly delicious. Start with the lentil sambusas and make sure to request the sauce.

I have yet to have a mediocre veggie here - the hot and cold dishes are amazingly fresh and flavorful.  Standouts are the kik alicha, tekil gomen, and a couple of amazing dishes I haven't seen on the menu as standalones, a cold lentil sour sort of salad, and some pickled beets.  The injera is warm and soft and perfectly sour and spongy for soaking up the delicious sauces and juices of the food.  Meats... oh the meats.  While you would not in any way suffer as a vegetarian at Shagga, this place is a meat lover's dream.  The doro wat is deliciously spicy.  The lamb of any kind is perfectly tender and perfectly spiced.  The beef tibs are juicy and not dry at all.  The minchet may be my favorite though.  It is comfort food at its best.  And with the portions being large, it reheats beautifully the next day which is a huge plus.  If you're daring, the kitfo raw is also amazing. \n\nHave I mentioned the coffee?  This is easily my favorite cup of coffee in the area.  Granted it takes them forever and a day to make it, but that's just kind of the speed of this place.

This place is really small and incredibly sparse and located in a random area. \n\nWe ordered the lamb wot, chicken something, beef tibb combination for 2. Such a great choice! The lamb wot had to be the best of the three, with the beef tibb a close second and the chicken close behind. Everything was so good. I'm salivating thinking about it again. It came with 4 different veggie sides, 2 that were lentil based I think, a tomato salad, and a cabbage salad. The spongy bread was not as sour as most places I've been too which was nice. Really helped let the dishes shine. \n\nThe service was great. Definitely a family owned shop. Kids home from school working in the corner and the adults drinking coffee and such close by.

No music, no talking, air was warm. 2 other customers were already there-  1 older guy drinking at 11am (he had about 3 before he left) and 1 lady on her nook (free wi-fi). The staff (one lady) was very nice, quiet, and well reserved. The water was warm and the ice melted quickly. We got the mango and banana smoothies - thanks for the heads up from other yelpers. The coffee was dark and strong.  We got the chicken app- my friends described it as an empanadas/egg roll/crab Rangoon app. It was good. We ordered #4 combo- chicken,lamb, beef. Thanks to other yelpers we ordered just one and it was enough for 4. The enjera (bread) was tasty. To me it looked like adipose tissue, spongy look. It was nice and soft. The meats were great too. My fav was the chicken- spicy and tender. Be careful with the chiles in the salad. There was no napkins around, so we used the table cloth. Towards the end the air kicked in and xm radio turned on. \n\nThe reason I gave it 3 stars was because I thought it would be better. I guess I need to get out more.

The building itself is the worst part; it looks like an old convenience store or laundromat.  But do not judge a book by it's cover.  Check this place out and you will be glad that you did.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:56:35Z","yelp_user_id":"bIlkPbqHKbmiuQH3yfTsWw"},{"business_id":"Znl2P0iZNNHXxvf5jQRKAg","created_at":"2013-03-15T16:36:48Z","date":"2009-04-10","review_id":"vi6o1yWs6a1R9nagmHeiQg","stars":3,"text":"This place seems to be improving, and I'm pulling for it to succeed. The food has been delicious every time I've gone there - I can't remember the name of the dish, but the \"potatoes and carrots\" was amazing. The \"improvement\" is in everything else. The first time I went, I wanted to have coffee and work on my laptop, but no outlets. I see they have them now. Its in a converted donut shop, so it still has that feel, but every time I go, they seem to be changing the interior bit by bit. The family that runs it is super nice, and its the kind of place that your two-year old can run around and be a two year old, and everyone seems to be cool about it. Unfortunately, part of that is because every time we have gone we are the only customers there. Sometimes I want to give them advice, a la Jerry Seinfeld, to improve the place, but I've held back since everything I seem to touch loses money. They actually have a selection of beer and wine, but the first few times we went, nothing of the sort was offered. At any rate, for the food and friendliness I give it four stars, but the place itself is still a work in progress so - three stars.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T02:30:25Z","yelp_user_id":"pvLUfwl-TlHJ0TDxlV5v4A"},{"business_id":"Znl2P0iZNNHXxvf5jQRKAg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:25:36Z","date":"2011-09-03","review_id":"W1sG3aWJzkMUF-6_Cs5KRw","stars":4,"text":"I am a big fan of Shagga even though my spicy-food tolerance isn't.

The rawness, for me, actually makes it one of the tamer dishes heat wise. \n\nThe vegetable sides were good, I loved the cabbage. Finally the injeera. Okay this may sound weird, but the only other time I've eaten Ethiopian the injeera left a chalky residue on my hands, at Shagga it didn't or perhaps I didn't notice it? What does this mean? Does that indicate that one place uses entirely teff or a teff-wheat blend? Please let me know if you have any idea - I'm very curious. \n\nI think this is honestly the best Ethipian I've ever had.

We like Dukem in DC, but we don't always have the time to travel into the city.  Having Shagga right in Hyattsville, where the old donut shop was, is so great.  Hands down, one of the best locally owned restaurants in the area.  \n\nIt's a small casual eatery.  We went for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  There was a mixture of regulars and new timers.  It was quiet and laid back.  \n\nThe food took a long time to come out, but this is probably because it was Sunday.  We didn't mind too much because it allowed us time to relax.  The lady who runs the place is super nice and friendly.  \n\nWe ordered two sambusas and the meat combination for two.  The sambusas are thin, seemingly wrapped in spring roll wrappers, and super tasty.  We had a beef and chicken.  Delish!  Each is $1.50 or a half dozen for $7.50.  We definitely wanted more!  The meat combo was also delish.  The quantity of food is about 3x that at Dukem for about the same price.  The cheese was rich and cool.  The lentils were very good.  All the meat dishes was spicy and delectable.  The only item we wouldn't order again is the kikfo.  It was too mushy for our tastes.\n\nWe are looking forward to going again.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:49:17Z","yelp_user_id":"EphbhIE7MrXpX_KbwJ_4kA"},{"business_id":"Znl2P0iZNNHXxvf5jQRKAg","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:47:58Z","date":"2009-12-23","review_id":"yEyyczcLWi4_K3sr0nusrw","stars":4,"text":"Though it looks like a Dunkin' Donuts, the food and service are good and prices reasonable.

Some automatically shout out the big names (Dukem, Addis Ababa) .  While all those places have their charm and supporters, I think I have to go with Shagga for the very reason that it is often not mentioned in the greats of DC Ethiopian.\n\nThis tiny, unassuming place off Route 1 is definitely a family owned and run joint.  It's rare to see more than 5-10 people at this place; even during meal rush hours.  And I think that is its top selling point.  I know it's horrible to praise a restaurant on its lack of customers, but some of us don't like having to shout over the crowds at places like Dukem or Addis Ababa.  It's lack of overcrowded yupsters and party people give it a secret charm- like this is our place and only we know about it.\n\nFirst off, the sambusas are top notch.  I get the veggie ones and my better half gets the meat ones- I rave over mine and she raves over her's.  Good deal.  I usually go for the veggie combo because I hate having to choose from so many delicious choices.

But since I moved recently closer to Center City, I wanted to find a place where I can wait while my car is being serviced. So when I found that Pep Boys at this location offers 29min oil change and also provides online appointments, I decided to give it a shot. \n\nI made a 8am appointment the night before for oil change and repair on gas tank heat shield (although I didn't know this was the issue at the time) and got to the place exactly at 8am, which is when they open the door. They also take overnight drops, which get serviced before the first appointment of the day, so I expected somewhat of a delay. They have a waiting area in the store, so I waited there for about an hour. There were a few people before me who also waited in the waiting area. I also walked around the store and bought some air filters. (By the way, the store is quite big and well stocked, it seems) After about tow hours of waiting, I went up to the service desk to ask about the progress of my car service, the guy gave me a nonchalant look and went back to look at some paper work. Then, he tells me that I am the next car to be serviced. By this time, I was getting a little bit impatient but I hold my tongue since I only have to wait a little bit more. Or so I thought. After about another hour with me hovering over the service desk, they pull me into the service area to show me a gas tank heat shield that came off on one bolt as the socket rotted away. They gave me two options - 1) I take it to Midas to get it welded (they don't do welding here apparently) or 2) just take it off completely.  The reason why I brought in my car in the first place was because of a clanking noise coming from the back, which I now found out was due to the heat shield hitting the exhaust pipe. So I considered just taking it off completely since that would stop the noise. But my instinct told me no. So after four hours (!) I come home and go to Midas the next day and they tell me I definitely need the heat shield and I need to take it to Toyota dealership. \n\nSo here's the gist of my experience at Pep Boys at this location: a looooong wait and one bad advice, which I fortunately didn't take.  Their 29min oil change is a joke because what they mean is it'll take 29min to change your oil IF there are no other cars that are being serviced at the moment. And they do have a lot of mechanics working in the back too.\n\nI will not go back to this place for any servicing related issues.

It's a standalone restaurant nestled next to Quality Inn. You'll see some hungover students stumbling as they walk out the door (not really, but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens every Sunday morning).\n\nYes, Curtis and I went to Plato's on Sunday morning. While we expected the diner to be absolute chaos, we were seated immediately at a booth (with cute handpainted murals on the walls). The restaurant isn't pseudo-retro like Silver Diner, but not minimally furnished and soulless like IHOP. \n\nThe menu selection is not unlike other diners'. You have breakfast items available all day, as well as lunch and dinner options. Really, who orders Prime Rib at a diner?\n\nSpeaking of meat, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find VEGETARIAN SAUSAGES on the menu! I have never been to a restaurant that offers that for breakfast! Sure, it costs like $2.89 extra, but I still ordered them on my breakfast sandwich. Yummy.\n\nA minor plus is that Plato's doesn't offer two different sizes for juice drinks. I normally order a small tomato or orange juice because I'm cheap like that. (Though if I'm at a fast food joint , I am willing to upgrade for a few cents if the cashier asks, but they don't do that anymore. That saves a few calories.)\n\nPlato's Diner is nothing to wildly rave about, it is an establishment in College Park among locals and college students. The prices are reasonable, the servers are friendly enough, and they offer freakin' vegetarian sausages.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:31:39Z","yelp_user_id":"kOUfmfOwUFtjau-OPF0F9w"},{"business_id":"zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:30:09Z","date":"2011-02-02","review_id":"_syuS1XbgXAeI-HNIkiB3Q","stars":3,"text":"Plato's Diner is one of the best diners in the DC metro area.

When you wanted decent food after midnight (but before sunrise) in College Park... Plato's was among the only options.  And it probably wouldn't kill you.  \n\nThe diner has changed hands a few times over the last ten years, and undergone a series of changes that are wholly for the better.  It's cleaned up a lot, and been decorated with murals of Greece, gods, statuary, mythology, etc.  It's still a bit tattered (and sometimes we are seated in the booth with the torn seats and the missing light), but it's good for four things - breakfast, Greek food, burgers, and dessert.

They have homefries instead of hashbrowns.  Omelettes are huge, and their pancakes have that fluffy texture that I can never duplicate at home.

I am usually very understanding with servers cause let's face it their job usually means dealing with really crappy mean people and I don't want to be one of them. But if you're a horrible waitress then I have no sympathy! \n\nFirst off after we were seated and no one came to wait our table. After 10minutes of waiting we had to ask if someone was going to serve us. After we asked the waitress brought us our water and said she would be back to take our order. After another 20 MINUTES, we still had no one come to take our order!  We went to the manager  to tell them no one has come to take our order and its been over a 30minute wait and instead of apologizing they insisted we were wrong and tried to argue with us!  Hello, we knew how long we were waiting we were looking at the big clock you had us seated right near the whole time we were waiting! \n\nAnyways, we tried to put that past us and just have a good time....but that would not be possible as I look back now. We ordered our food and they said it would take 20 minutes to cook.  Yippy...(Even though usually the food comes out much faster than that! ) \nExactly twenty minutes later we got our food. By this time people that were seated after us had already eaten, paid and left.. -_- \n \nMy friends asked for hot sauce and mayo to eat with his burger and it didn't end up coming out after 5minutes and he was just too hungry to argue or wait so just ate it without. She finally brought the hot sauce and still forgot the mayo. She remembered she forgot though.. (I'll give her points for that?..) but his food was gone so it didn't matter. \n\nWe then wanted some coffee and cake so we ordered some. I wanted a tuxedo cheese cake which I saw in the glass case in the front no more than 5 minutes earlier because I got up to see what they had. When I ordered it, she said that they didn't have it.. (even though I physically saw it) and argued with me about what it was called. I was like whatever the cake is called I want \"this cake\"... and ended up describing exactly what the cake I wanted looked like and told her to bring that one. She ends up bringing out a cake that looks absolutely nothing like I wanted.... surprise surprise... and I was just too tired to fight it so I ate it, and it was dry and yucky. \n\nShe brought out our cakes but no coffee, and we just thought she forgot. After we finished our cakes she said the grounds got in the coffee and they are making another batch. (How do they mess up coffee making?) My friends said to scratch the decaf coffee cause he ordered it to drink with his cake but she decided to argue with us more saying since she put it on the check we might as well wait, and we had to force her to take it off our check. After a 2 and a half hour meal ( which mostly consisted of waiting) I don't think we wanted to wait anymore lady! \n\nAnyways we were finally out of our dining hell and I can proudly say  we survived without developing any anger issues and I still have faith in humanity even though she was testing me that night. You know some people have sour attitudes but  you can't let that bring you down in life. \n\nI now will be avoiding Platos and I want to save you all from what I had to experience so you all can maintain your positive attitudes and personal happiness.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:12:45Z","yelp_user_id":"xbKbI5zu5GPs8W5AWhRZfg"},{"business_id":"zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:08:11Z","date":"2009-08-14","review_id":"fzwvbxaRc_PVlQHWZk9ugQ","stars":5,"text":"Breakfast anytime of day.

I was reminded of this bon mot while visiting friends in College Park this Sunday. Being in the mood for gyros, I hit Yelp and saw that a joint called Gyromania was selling them, and with a name like that, how could I lose? I was in Maryland. That's how I could lose. Of course, like most things in Maryland on Sunday, it was closed. This has been a longstanding tradition in Maryland that pre-dates Chik fil A. Apparently, you'd have to be insane to want to eat at a restaurant or buy liquor on Sunday. You should really be attending your church (or \"synagogue\"), not paying to have someone give you food. No matter. You're in a college town and college kids have no idea how to feed themselves. They'll subsist off Lean Cuisines, cold pizza, and beercan ashtrays for months on end. Surely there's something open peddling gyros.\n\nBack on Route 1, I remembered that Marathon Deli sold some excellent gyros back in the day. They may today, but I'll never know, because it too was closed. So now we're in third-tier gyro territory, which found me at Plato's Diner. Now, you'd figure with a name like that, at least they'd have decent Greek food, but remember: we're in Maryland. When I went to the University of Maryland in the Pleistecene Era, this place used to be a Howard Johnsons serving the typical HoJos meals: meatloaf, burgers, clam strips. A hotel in back ensured the fryers were running on all eight cylinders and the staff could handle a few diner basics. At some point, it became one of those chrome-plated retro diner joints that manage to combine the worst elements of chain dining and kitsch. I put in a carry out order for gyros and fries ($8.50). About ten minutes later, I was given a styrofoam box. At this point, it goes downhill. \n\nIn a nanny state like Maryland, you'd figure they'd have some state-wide requirement that gyros actually resembled gyros instead of grilled bologna strips embedded with bits of burnt ca-ca. Yes, they've gone the route of every other place that doesn't want the financial and training responsibility of actually owning a gyro spit. What passes for gyros here are the Sysco cryovac zero-prep gyro \"product\" that's infecting the once noble tradition of Greek gyros. This stuff resembles gyros in the same way that Hitler resembles a human being. Truly horrible in that \"I can't believe I'm eating greasy burnt bologna embedded with bits of ca-ca, but I'm f**king starving\" sort of way. Snappy service, though, and the cashier was nice enough to give us a free refill on our Coke while we were waiting. The fries were also nice and crisp and not those execrable \"coated\" fries. So if good service and fries are more important that edible gyros, I'm sure you could have a nice time at Plato's Diner having breakfast or staring at the linoleum. But until Maryland enters the 20th Century and starts repealing their blue laws, I'll steer clear of the gyros at this joint.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:50:58Z","yelp_user_id":"6StY4RUgrbALvkV6p-KGXw"},{"business_id":"zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:16:51Z","date":"2012-09-05","review_id":"hrcF7103MbbH9CRvDKWJrw","stars":3,"text":"This is a great place to stop by and get some decent diner food, which is always delicious at odd hours of the night during the weekend.

I used to really like this place.  I love diners because the great range of food they offer and the overall ambiance of the place that makes me feel like I could plop down a deck of cards while waiting for my food.  Plato's has a very tasty Red Hot and Blue burger that I am absolutely in love with.  However, almost a year ago, my experience there was more than ruined.  I've had some bad experiences here before, but continued to go because I know that if I came back a different day, things would be different.  One fateful (very slow) night, my party of four accidentally turned into a party of five.  Our waiter was fantastic.  He KNEW that our additional person came from a table of people that had already been there.  We just so happened to bump into a dear friend of ours that decided to join us.  Only four people ate...and we actually only needed to split the bill 3 ways.  The waiter did this for us without any problems.  However, the host was a complete jerk.  Like...made a big deal and made us feel like idiots type of complete jerk.  So I wrote a complaint...something I've never done before.  The owner was very apologetic, sent us a $50 gift certificate so that we'd come back.  We eventually went back and I thought all was well.  However, a close friend of mine who works in this sort of business was friends with this host.  The host was very ungrateful and said he hated me and my group.  He got into a lot of trouble for be unpleasant, which I think he deserved.  He all but actually said we'd be sorry if we came back there when we was speaking with my friend.  Sounds like a threat to me.  I will NEVER go back here EVER EVER EVER again.  Which is a shame, because the food is great.  Not so long as people can't act like adults instead of laughing at a group of people that walk in to sit down in your restaurant to help pay YOUR salary.  Even if he decided to man up and be real about the whole thing, I'd still never go back here.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:52:07Z","yelp_user_id":"VTnmzmOZu9mf56rT9to4fg"},{"business_id":"zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:50:21Z","date":"2010-10-10","review_id":"Isgb2omRQkjaKbrK37UPtA","stars":2,"text":"DC is seriously lacking in good diners. I was hoping that humble college park would offer me something better, being somewhat of a college town. I had high hopes for this place. My experience with Greek diners was usually good. I was hoping to find a gyro omelette, unfortunately my search yielded no such results. Our server seemed like he hated his job, so instead of being a jerk and ordering off menu (gyro omelette), I made the mistake of ordering the mile high meatloaf sandwich. \n\nWhere do I even begin, in describing my disappointment? The first thing I noticed about the sandwich was the gravy. The menu described it as being a \"BBQ gravy\". This should have been a red flag, but no... my curiousity delved me deeper into troublesome territory. The BBQ gravy was odd. It was as if they took BBQ sauce, and added powdered gravy mix to it, only causing it to further coagulate, and make what could only be described as a \"glop\" of semi-liquid, semi-solid amorphous blob of disappointment. This was of course, only the start of the long list of disappointing features of the dish.\n\nBeneath the fa\u00e7ade of gravycue sauce was meatloaf atop toast, topped with mashed potatoes. The portion was huge, and the \"mile-high\" moniker is rightly so. My disappointment was also mile-high as I don't like leaving food on my plate, so I felt I had to power through this meal just so I could \"man-up\" in front of my male compatriots. The mashed potatoes were odd. They weren't box, but they DEFINITELY weren't freshly made either. Maybe they just mixed the dry flakes in with laundry detergent powder, or SOMETHING. The mashers were off. But that wasn't even the bad part. \n\nThe meatloaf....good LAWD the meatloaf was just not good. Okay okay, I realize that in signing up to eat meatloaf, I'm not allowed to complain, just as when your mom/grandma makes meatloaf, you don't complain you just eat it. Well, the thing is, I actually like, maybe possibly even love meatloaf. But this meatloaf they gave me was the problem child that you're just trying to find room in your heart to love, but just can't. The meatloaf was lacking in flavor, and the little flavor it did have was not a very good one. I gotta give it to them, it's hard to have fresh meatloaf on hand, when you have such a huge menu. I doubt ANYONE ever orders it, so when I made the mistake of doing so, I'm sure the short-order cook begrudgingly went into the back freezer and pulled out some meatloaf that probably expired in 2000, and tried to put some \"life back into it\" by dousing it in a hot fudge-like consistency \"BBQ gravy\" sauce. \n\nLessons learned - Just don't order something crazy like this. Sure, it's plato's diner, sure it's late at night and you may have been drinking, and the prospect of sopping up all that alcohol with delicious meatloaf sounds tempting, but in case you just skimmed my review to get to this point, THE MEATLOAF IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL. \n\nMy friends also got the club sandwich (half decent), and the Spanikopita. The Spanikopita was also disappointing. Instead of being put inside of flaky phyllo dough, it was more like if they put it in a phyllo dough burrito, with non-flaky dough, some weird cheese mixture that may have had traces of feta, but more/so some other mysterious cheese that tasted nowhere near as good, and the spinach... The spinach was frozen, not properly thawed, and most importantly not properly seasoned. Spinach needs a good liberal dousing of salt to taste right, especially frozen spinach, and this was nowhere near as good. Add on top of that my friend felt sick later. \n\nOKAY! I hate writing scathing reviews, and I know it's hard to operate a restaurant, especially one that operates 24-hours a day, and has actually reasonable (possibly even affordable) prices. Two stars to this place, because the service wasn't really that bad, everyone else around our table seemed to enjoy their food, which was then when I realized that they had all gotten breakfast food. It's probably the way to go when eating here, and even though I'll never come back, if you do find yourself at Plato's diner, just order the breakfast already.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:07:52Z","yelp_user_id":"9NjyPHg3q0TCJzkVc4L0-w"},{"business_id":"zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T19:26:30Z","date":"2008-11-24","review_id":"j1n-UumecwD4at2B0k-RvA","stars":4,"text":"I always get Greek food here.

My favorite part about diners is I never know what to order.  There are always 400 things on the menu that sound delish.  This was that type of diner and I loved that!  I finally settled on the chicken souvlaki salad (and the waitress even let me get spinach salad instead of dreaded iceberg).  It was piled to the ceiling w/freshly-grilled chicken that was seasoned perfectly.  It also came with warm pita, homemade tzaziki, feta, tomatoes, kalamata olives, and cucumbers (I had them hold onions and peppers, but those come with it, too).  It was humungous.  My friend ordered the Greek chicken plate, which was HUGE.  He got the Maryland crab soup, a salad, and a vegetable with it.  The chicken already came with oven-roasted potatoes, so he got the french fries for me (I begged--it was SO worth it! They were a-MAZing).  When his plate came out, we both kind of sunk down b/c it looked a little bland, to be honest.  His soup was a bit salty, but otherwise good.  The chicken had nice flavor but was a little bit dry.  I would not recommend you order that dish, but there are certainly a million others to choose from.  If you want Greek-style chicken, stick to the souvlaki.

Hershel's has made me feel like less of a man. \n\n\"But how can that be, Jeff? You're all man!\" is what you would be saying. At least, that's what I imagine you would be saying for the sake of my fragile ego. And in response to you, kind reader, I give the following explanation:\n\nI feel like less of a man because one sandwich from Hershel's put me in a food coma for the remainder of the day. I ate half of the sandwich, and then spent ten minutes looking at the other half while trying to figure out how I was going to tackle that corned beef behemoth. I think my brain was trying to process how I could enjoy the deliciousness that was the Corned Beef Special, while also not upchucking right after because I already felt like my diaphragm was up to my neck. So yeah, I did feel somewhat emasculated that as a man, I was letting this damn sandwich triumph over me. But after those ten minutes, and also due to the verbal abuse of my friends (various derogatory terms that are synonyms for the word \"cat\") I dove into the second half, and then proceeded to pass out. I remember thinking that if I was going to die, I couldn't really think of a better way of dying. \"Did you hear that he died because he was overwhelmed by the awesomeness of a corned beef sandwich? Apparently there was crack in there, because he couldn't stop eating it.\" \n\nAnyway, I've wasted enough of your time, dear reader. The corned beef special was my first experience with corned beef, and I loved it. I hate coleslaw; like, genuinely, abhor with a fiery passion, that most disgusting of side dishes, and that sandwich even managed to make me rethink coleslaw. It was the messiest sandwich I've eaten, and I'm pretty sure that my intestines still haven't finished processing the meaty goodness, and I had it yesterday at 11:00 am. It was worth it.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:12:16Z","yelp_user_id":"itI6CqeR92ikei1n86N5sg"},{"business_id":"Zqd_DHAtrdzRJ8u3zwrvEA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:52:57Z","date":"2010-02-23","review_id":"-B-7wYchffhyHOddS9rAtA","stars":5,"text":"Their Reuben is a must.

Yep.  And the tacos are hard or soft shell.  No real Mexican place serves crunchy shells.  We also couldn't figure out the difference between a burrito and taco here, as they each have meat, cheese, and lettuce.  Um, okay.\n\nThe menu boasts of patents for their sauces; well, they needn't worry, as no one will be stealing their sauce recipes.\n\nImagine a sauce lacking in the basics--cumin, onion, garlic, cayenne.  Even marinara has all but the cumin or possibly cayenne.  Here?  None of the above.  No cilantro either, and you can choose to have munster cheese added to a burrito.  Yep, that staple of Mexican cuisine, munster cheese.\n\nAlso, the tacos have lettuce on them, in addition to the munster cheese, no cilantro in sight.  Why am I going off on munster?  If you're going to Americanize it, at least use Monterey Jack, cheddar or American/square/yellow cheese!  Wendy's chili sauce, Taco Bell, and those tiny MSG laden packets from Olde El Paso have more seasoning than this stuff.\n\nOh, and if you're on a low sodium/sodium restricted diet, go here.  I rarely if ever salt my food, but here I had to salt even the guacamole, which came from a squeezy packet--perfectly smooth and perfectly bland.  We're also convinced that they refilled the El Tapatio sauce with their special patented sauce, as it too was bland.  I asked Jim whether it was just me craving salt on a hot and humid day while pregnant, but sadly, he had to agree that it needed salt.  \n\nPros: it's clean, and the service is nice.  But the food?

The one where the people's hair are flying in a tornado. So, I came across this location closest to NY to try their seafood. We had such a great time! It reminded me of my trip a few summers ago to Daytona, FL. \n\nOur waiter stringed \"Let's Get Crackin\" bibs around us. The waiters and waitresses perform a few dances to Cotton Eyed Joe, Cha Cha Slide, and other 80's tunes which was pretty entertaining. It's a very laid-back and mellow atmosphere. \n\nFor some reason, it was everyone's birthday. About 8 cakes were brought out and announced to everyone while belting happy birthday tunes. Unlike the typical dining leisure, this place really brings out the relaxed and fun side of us. \n\nWe shared the Great Balls of Fire for an appetizer: jalapeno, shrimp, and crab balls with cheddar & sour cream was really good. It also included a side of fries. \n\nI had the Ragin Canjun steampot- 1 pound of dungeness/snow crabs, shrimp, potatoes, fresh corn, and sausage all spiced up cajun style. My husband had the Key West Chicken glazed with mango jalapeno sauce with crabmeat and rice. My sisters both shared the Bean TownBake for two- 2 whole lobsters, 1 pound of clams & shrimp, sausage, fresh corn, and sausage. My brother had the Samuel Adam's Steampot- 1 pound of Alaskian King Crab, 1 pound shrimp, potatoes, fresh corn and sausage flavored in Samuel Adams and a bit of Old Baye seasoning. \n\nIn the end, it was messy and good ole fun! We were trading here and there to sample our steampots. I think the overall experience is a lot better than Red Lobster. More seafood and a table full of shells & laughs. For dessert, we shared the Key Lime Pie w/ whipped cream and the Sea Turtle Sundae-Chocolate cake a la mode topped with caramel and candied nuts. Key Lime was definitely not as good or famous as Daytona but it did the job.

The hostess told us it would be an hour and 20 minutes for a table when we got there, which seemed odd because there were empty tables not being bussed and the staff appeared to be all hanging out by the server station.   My suspicions were correct and we got our seat in about 30 minutes.  That was the best part of the meal.  \n\nOur seat was way off in the corner of the bar area, and it smelled like old, stickey beer.  It took our server 15 minutes before she even came over and acknowledged us.  I watched her sing happy birthday, take a desert order, give a table their check and get them change before she took our drink and dinner order.  \n\nWe ordered king crab legs and sodas.  Our drinks came out fast and so did the melted butter for our crabs.  We then sat there for 40 minutes with zero contact from any staff.   Our server must have had to run home to add the fabric softener, because she was nowhere to be found for the entire time.  After 40 minutes of watching their lackluster and disorganized staff go through the motions, what appeared to be a manager approached our table with the food.  I say \"appeared\" because this is the same guy who was standing at the server station chatting with his staff while customers were told it would be an hour and a half for a table while there were empty tables sitting for 10 to 15 minutes without being cleaned off and seated.  He walked over like frankenstein and said this and only this: \"this is the old bay and this is the garlic\".  \n\nThe server came over and said that was her manager and she was very sorry for the wait.  She confirmed our ticket had sat there for 40 minutes and finally she had to go \"talk to someone in the back\".  I can just imagine how that talk went.  \"wow it finally slowed down, it's almost empty out there.  Hey, what's that behind those boxes?\" \n\nWell we got the crab legs, they were mediocre.  She forgot the hush puppies, whatever.  Some people sat down next to us, ordered and had their food in 10 minutes while we ate our very fishy smelling crab legs.  The quality of the crab seemed low, probably frozen.  And the way it's prepared makes the shell bend instead of break.  \n\nAnyway,  the two orders of crab legs and two sodas cost me 90 bucks.

In fact, it became one of my favorites the first time I stepped in the door. I usually have my two goddaughters with me when I go (it's on the way between my home and theirs), and it's their \"most favoritist\" place in the world to eat.\n\nJoe's is a fun, family-friendly place with outstanding food, reasonable prices, and a magnificently gawdy decor. There's a big sign on the side that actually says \"EAT AT JOE'S\", and the interior is decorated with all sorts of maritime- and fishing-related paraphernalia.\n\nJoe's also has the most relaxed, most family-friendly environment of any high-quality restaurant I've ever patronized. They have hula hoops and other toys, an outdoor playground for the kids, and a guy who makes balloon animals. In addition, all the servers do little dance numbers every 20 minutes or so, and guests are encouraged to join in and dance with them.\n\nThe servers -- who dress in jeans and tee-shirts to help set the relaxed mood -- are truly exceptional. My girls routinely go around and hug them  all -- they have come know them by name -- as soon as we walk in, and this doesn't bother the staff in the least. I reprimanded the girls the first time they did it, but I was told not to worry about it -- that they were glad the kids felt at home because that's exactly the mood they want to create.\n\nAs for the food, it is exceptionally good. All the food is always fresh and each meal is cooked to order, however, so this is not a place to go if you're in a hurry (or if you're anal). Order some appetizers and drinks and let yourself unwind while you wait for your entree. Get up and dance with the waitstaff. Sing along, too. Or grab a hula hoop if you want: they're hanging on the wall by the restrooms. No one will mind. Really. The food is well worth the wait, so have fun.\n\nThe specialty, of course, is crabs, which are served in many different ways. There are also other seafood dishes, of which I've tried maybe half over the course of time. All have been excellent. Like most seafood restaurants, there also are steaks and other non-seafood dishes available for non-fish lovers. The only one I've tried has been the steak, which was excellent. The appetizers also are novel and delicious. (Don't miss the Crazy Good Crab Dip. It's, well, crazy good.)\n\nThe prices at Joe's are moderate, but still a very good value considering the quality of the food. They're certainly less expensive than many other seafood restaurants of lesser caliber. The pre-tax, pre-tip tab for appetizers, main course, desert, and soft drinks for myself and the two kids (who order adult portions of crabs -- these kids are no slouches when it comes to eating) is usually around $70.00 - $80.00 at Joe's, which really isn't bad at all for a quality seafood dinner for three.\n\nThe portions at Joe's are about right, which is to say that they're generous, but not excessive. Crabs and seafood in general don't lend themselves too well to doggy bags because they don't reheat well. Nonetheless, we usually manage to have some leftovers to take home.\n\nIn summary, if you like shellfish and aren't too anal to enjoy a place where the wait staff dances and hip boots hang from the ceiling, be sure to give Joe's a try.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T22:48:16Z","yelp_user_id":"1OZudFY_Oi4edCYsAg19IQ"}]},{"business":{"business_id":"ZvyWZ1KAMiBKZnZqjVDzYQ","city":"Philadelphia","created_at":"2013-03-15T06:39:56Z","full_address":"3943 Chestnut St\nUniversity City\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104","latitude":39.9558,"longitude":-75.2021,"name":"Papa John's","open":true,"photo_url":"http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/924a6444ca6c/gfx/blank_biz_medium.gif","review_count":3,"stars":2.5,"state":"PA","updated_at":"2013-03-15T06:39:56Z","url":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/papa-johns-philadelphia-2"},"reviews":[{"business_id":"ZvyWZ1KAMiBKZnZqjVDzYQ","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:41:02Z","date":"2011-02-27","review_id":"acYbm4JVtyebIRE74m6VCA","stars":3,"text":"Standard Papa Johns.

When I returned home, I noticed something unusual: my gray Zegna button-down now featured two new varieties of buttons. In black and brown. The remaining, factory buttons were a shiny gray color, so black and brown don't exactly match. To add insult to injury, they sewed them on improperly with thread dangling off.\n\nMy first impulse was to run down there and tear someone's head off, but I realized I should probably investigate my two Armani shirts.

Fish and meat were both well cooked, the flavors were well balanced and original, and even though everything had a unique taste to it... it somehow still felt like comfort food, so pretty ideal on a rainy Sunday.  If all you care about is getting some tasty Norwegian food then Haakon's Hall has you covered.\nThe service, is really mediocre at best.  After we ordered bread plates were brought out... then after our food arrived I heard one waiter say to the other \"aren't you going to bring them bread?\" and suddenly our bread arrived.  The service throughout the meal had that sort of \"we are still getting the hang of this\" feel, which is part of why I would rate this 3 instead of 4 stars.  I'll probably go back in the future to see if they have worked all of the kinks out. \nThe draught selection is also really unfortunate.  I'm not sure if I should call myself a beer snob... I brew my own, I love going to beer bars and trying new beers, and I spend a lot of time hating on macrobrews... so maybe I am more of a beer asshole.  With its big bar, its super convenient location, and cheap draughts, HH would be a great place to drag coworkers for happy hour... but the draught list is a mine field of average beers (Rolling Rock, Stella, Blue Moon, Becks, Guinness... you get the idea) with only two house beers to cut through the mess.  I would love to see someone who cares about beer step up and help this place out.  \nFinally, this doesn't really effect the review, but I wish they would create an offering for the take out lunch crowd.  I don't know anything about running a restaurant but it seems like they are missing out on a major income source by not offering some sort of food option for the usual $7-$9 take out during lunch.  \n\nSo, in a city where too often great places go down hill, it looks like HH may actually be getting better.  Good, original, food makes for a great base to build on, but its still 3 stars until I go back and see if all the kinks have been worked out.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T00:41:09Z","yelp_user_id":"6GrokFIVYpmEETAcsqrNxg"},{"business_id":"zzh3XNV25Fngor_E72aGWg","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:49:11Z","date":"2012-05-29","review_id":"YczHqL7HhgdpgCjgDmRVmw","stars":5,"text":"Classic Columbia hangout  - we always end up having a great time here.","updated_at":"2013-03-15T21:49:11Z","yelp_user_id":"_VZcukt61mift9y6fUPK-Q"},{"business_id":"zzh3XNV25Fngor_E72aGWg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:47:45Z","date":"2011-01-27","review_id":"YxiZC934YRuSOZXW3ASrlQ","stars":4,"text":"I would really give Haakon's Hall 3 1/2 stars but that wasn't an option and so I bumped them up a little bit.\n\nI came here with my friend for lunch and we had a good experience. I ordered the burger which came with fries and their coleslaw. The fries and coleslaw were amazing, the burger was just okay.\n\nMy friend got their bento box lunch special, which came with vegetarian lasagna, salad, garlic bread and chocolate cake with whipped cream. All for $9.95. What an amazing deal. She said the lasagna and the salad were great. The chocolate cake was just okay.\n\nOther diners complained abt the service, but they seem to have changed it up now. You order at a counter and pay and then they call your name when your food is ready and you go and pick it up. If you are looking for a fine dinning experience this is not the place to come, but if you don't mind serving yourself it is cool.\n\nOverall, Hakkon's Hall was a good experience and everyone who worked there seemed nice enough to me.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:41:30Z","yelp_user_id":"WqM44RyUNcQhSgTj2I68xQ"},{"business_id":"zzh3XNV25Fngor_E72aGWg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:50:43Z","date":"2009-09-05","review_id":"zaxvdOYke7SlxMhk3rLWGw","stars":4,"text":"Community Food and Juice meets IKEA (in a good way) at this vibrant and charming Morningside Heights spot. Fresh and tasty food, attentive service, and affordable prices make Haakon's Hall a welcome addition to the Columbia neighborhood. Kudos to the kitchen for a great meal! \n\n(1) Comparison to CFJ: Fresh comfort food (including warm cookies and milk), warm ambiance, a communal dining table, and loud; however, presentation is more homey and less artisanal than CFJ and unlike CFJ, Haakon's ingredients lack the imprimatur of eco-friendliness. \n\n(2) Similarities to IKEA's cafeteria (no offense intended - I like IKEA's cafeteria; also, my apologies to Scandinavians for this admittedly ignorant comparison): They serve Scandinavian-inspired food (see lingonberries below - sorry, where else can you get lingonberries!?), charge affordable prices for large servings of food, and offer a sufficiently diverse menu.\n\n(3) Food: I ordered the Amish rotisserie half chicken half (~$9.50); the chicken was flavorful and mostly tender (the breast meat was a bit dry, but far superior to Tom's limbless chicken special, see http://www.yelp.com/biz/toms-restaurant-new-york#hrid:mxJQ-oUQ38QPHnMjNxQ-_Q); the side dishes (mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) were very good. My wife ordered the Norwegian meat patties and sauteed vegetables ($13.50), which came with a fresh green salad with tomatoes in a light dressing, a side of lingonberry sauce, toasted bread, and a piece of cannoli. The patties were flavorful and tender and the sides were also tasty. For dessert, I could not resist the warm plate of cookies and cold milk ($8). They did not disappoint: the five large  homemade cookies were warm, gooey, and delicious (2 chocolate chip + 3 fudge with white chocolate chips). I think I've found my neighborhood alternative to Specialty's warm chocolate chip cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz/specialtys-cafe-and-bakery-san-francisco-12#hrid:R05FSWWymz5gAL14zRfz8Q).    \n\n(4) Service: Attentive and earnest, but a bit uneven. I had to order dessert twice and ask for the check twice.  \n\n(5) Price: We left satisfied and stuffed, having consumed two entrees and dessert for $40, including tax and tip - a great deal.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:36:56Z","yelp_user_id":"MJi8cYsq4NC2qYx48R1XRw"},{"business_id":"zzh3XNV25Fngor_E72aGWg","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:06:00Z","date":"2010-02-22","review_id":"zC7V6xual0gPOmuAI0U0uw","stars":4,"text":"Haakon's Hall food is unique and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.
