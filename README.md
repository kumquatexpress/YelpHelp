Our app will be the ideal tool to find high quality restaurants for your favorite meals during an all day excursion. The user will be able to select certain points of interest or a path they would like to take during the course of their travels. Our app will then suggest modified versions of the trip that include food stops for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner that were found to have excellent renditions of the dishes the user likes for each of those meals. 

Search for restaurants that serve a particular dish.
Assign meal ratings to each dish served at a particular restaurant.
Assess the dependability of each user and include that in the rating of meals/restaurants.
Plot search results on a map.
User can plot their desired sightseeing path on Google Maps.
Suggest restaurants along the path that are highly rated.
Suggest landmarks along the path that are highly rated.
User can specify favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals.
Generate modified path based on algorithm to decide optimal stops taking into account time, rating, proximity, and personal preference.
Create a brand new suggested path based only on a desired city complete with landmarks and restaurants to see along the way.





Tools - Languages, databases, toolkits etc. Whatever you decide to use, and for what you're using it.

Python, MySQL, Python NLTK.


Work Distribution - Try to be even about this. Try to be clear about this. We will not hold you to it, in that you may choose to change who does what as your project evolves, but this is where the buck stops. So if someone doesn't do their part, and there's no substitution, and your group is mad at you for ruining their grade, this will basically help you throw yourself under the bus alone, instead of dragging your entire group with you.
