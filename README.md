Title - A meaningful, short, application name



Abstract - In no more than five sentences, what your app does. This is what ALL TAs and Dr. Davidson will read, to get a basic idea of what your project is about. Make this your "elevator pitch" for your product.

Rating menu items dependent on reviews (NLP)

Walkscore?
Safety pathing
Pathing for tourism/best path to take to sightsee and go to good restaurants/landmarks
Input -> where to visit -> gives restaurant suggestions along the way
User draws a route on map (javascript?) and listing of proximal restaurants is displayed along the way
Graph visualization linked to yelp/fb friends -> link to foursquare in order to see where people have been
Weighted reviews by vertex distance from user on social network
Track friends using “location last detected” on the built-in yelp map, can also pull in foursquare data

Use Cases - Between one and three meaningful use cases of your app. You can use words, images, whatever you like to convey the idea.

Helps tourists plan out their vacations, acts as a tour guide of sorts.  Tourists would select their current location and the app would draw the best (shortest? safest? line of best fit?) path through the most optimal landmarks and restaurants.

Users would be able to track their friends’ locations for nights out, as well as visualize a map of locations with information about how often friends go there/opinions from friends.  Closer social network.



Features - Crystallize your idea into deliverable features. This is where the completeness part of your grade comes from. If you're able to achieve correctness in these features, you get a perfect score on it. Have at least 10 non trivial features. There might be some negotiation here between you and your TA mentor. If your TA mentor feels a feature isn't substantive enough, he may ask you to add one more to offset it. The idea is to have a uniform amount of complexity in all projects. Of course, different projects may have different areas of complexity. Someone may be using a really complex suggestion algorithm, another person may be doing some cool back end database stuff, someone may be implementing some security stuff, someone may choose to validate a review before entering it using some authentication mechanism or a captcha. Essentially, a feature is a deliverable, discernable module of your project. If you're at 20 features, you're either getting too ambitious or some of your features are trivial. This can be discussed and negotiated between you and your TA mentor once you've submitted your proposal, so don't worry too much about it, and post questions about whether something is a feature. If you think it is, add it to your proposal and then we'll help you make adjustments later.
Important Note about features: Create a numbered list. You may have a large description of your project, which contains the features, which you can feel free to include in the proposal, but under the heading of features, extract the actual features and print them, so that it's easy to look back on.




Tools - Languages, databases, toolkits etc. Whatever you decide to use, and for what you're using it.




Work Distribution - Try to be even about this. Try to be clear about this. We will not hold you to it, in that you may choose to change who does what as your project evolves, but this is where the buck stops. So if someone doesn't do their part, and there's no substitution, and your group is mad at you for ruining their grade, this will basically help you throw yourself under the bus alone, instead of dragging your entire group with you. meaningful, short, application name
