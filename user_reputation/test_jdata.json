We hired her to coordinate our rehearsal and day-of. Allison went above and beyond and did a great job. She was very good at making sure everything ran smoothly, and in helping us plan the big day without hiccups. During the event we ran out of prosecco (horrors!) and Allison ran out to get more. She is a really nice, professional, punctual person and I would recommend her for your event planning needs.","updated_at":"2013-03-29T01:32:51Z","yelp_user_id":"ArA03t6dDXs7iNSX7TNtbA"},{"business_id":"hGwCdB5rZh8u0myX3ggecA","created_at":"2013-03-15T20:23:12Z","date":"2012-09-12","review_id":"ojxerddmMkgWL8OJK2d5QQ","stars":5,"text":"Professional and easy to work with! They really strive to personalize your event and incorporate your design and taste!

Especially in design aspects, they really work to make a cohesive look and are mindful of details that you might forget if you were planning it yourself!  Personally, for my wedding, they were really invested and wanted to make my event the best it could be!

I got to tea places often so i kinda know what the normal standard for tea should be.  I ordered a Almond milk tea which seems like should be fairly common fair at a tea house.  It was easily the worst tea i had ever drank.  The tea it self tasted like water.  Barely any almond flavor.  It was supposed to be milk tea but it tasted like they had just mixed the almond flavor into water and called it quits.  The Boba had terrible consistency.  Tasted like oddly hard jello.  Not good at all.  I took two sips hoping it would get better on the second one.  When it didn't i threw it out.  There has to be better Boba then this in the area.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T21:35:59Z","yelp_user_id":"LFXUE7pWN_UH3usdbSRTlA"},{"business_id":"HGxPtG7uKNFtJK7cAvdqjw","created_at":"2013-03-15T21:52:00Z","date":"2008-09-11","review_id":"9kiVm7rMynvPDkeQ-OrIEA","stars":3,"text":"I walked here last night with my dear hubby who is fasting and in the mood for big portions, greasy food, lots of flavor and a high-calorie drink. (I would be too if I hadn't eaten or drank anything all day). It was my first time. First off, note that they only take cash - that can be a problem for people like me who use credit all day, every day.\n\nThe restaurant is casual, but they still insist on waiting to be seated and having wait staff take your order. I found this a little weird, but whatever. The menu was very extensive and is a mix of thai, chinese, and vietnamese. We didn't have trouble finding two entrees that would satisfy.\n\nWe started with a Thai Iced Tea with Boba. It was good, but overpriced! I think it cost us $3.25. Now, maybe this is the going rate in Westwood, but back when I was a college student Boba was never more than $1.25... sheesh.\n\nI got the Pan-Fried Spicy noodles with Chicken, he got the Beef Yakisoba. Both were decent. Too much oil!!! How  hard is it to reduce the amount of oil so I don't feel like I'm eating noodle soup?\n\nIt's hard to complain about the taste - very good. Spicy enough. Nice mix of fresh veggies and meat. Overall, I liked it. I think I would return if I am ever in the mood for greasy, greasy americanized Asian food. Someone please tell me if there is cheaper Boba nearby.","updated_at":"2013-03-28T23:05:26Z","yelp_user_id":"PaJRAXUr_u7_AAKwudmjFw"},{"business_id":"HGxPtG7uKNFtJK7cAvdqjw","created_at":"2013-03-15T22:41:58Z","date":"2007-08-18","review_id":"DXbHeZLIlgA_mElNeOX24w","stars":4,"text":"One of the few places you can satisfy your boba craving in Westwood, at least when I was there.

When I told them it was mixed up, the waitress rolled her eyes and acted mad that I wouldn't just take what she had made, even though it was wrong.
