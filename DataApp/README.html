    <h1>Installation: Two ways</h1>
    <p>
      RVM is much better if you ever want to work with ruby in the future, but the installation process might cause problems, so the second way is a lot shorter time-wise.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Install rvm at https://rvm.io/rvm/install/
          and then run 
          <code>
            $ rvm install 1.9.2
            $ rvm use 1.9.2
            $ sudo apt-get install mysql-client libmysql-ruby1.9.1 libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlite3-ruby1.9.1 
            $ gem install rails --include-dependencies --no-ri --no-rdoc
            $ cd DataApp && bundle install
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>2. If you have ruby1.8 installed, 
          <code>
            $ sudo apt-get purge ruby1.8
            $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
            $ sudo apt-get install mysql-client libmysql-ruby1.9.1 libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev libsqlite3-ruby1.9.1 
            $ gem install rails --include-dependencies --no-ri --no-rdoc
            $cd DataApp && bundle install
          </code>
        </li>
      </ul>  
  </p>
